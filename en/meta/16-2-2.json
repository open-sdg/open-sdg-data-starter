Every day, victims are exploited in restaurants, farms, construction sites, brothels, factories, markets, mines and in people&#x2019;s homes everywhere, but little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of the crime. Better data is needed to inform more effective responses, and provide policymakers and practitioners with the information and analysis they need to sharpen anti-trafficking action and improve prevention.</p>\n<p>This indicator aims to measure the prevalence of trafficking in persons according to the victims profile and the forms of exploitation, and to track global, regional, and national progress in combatting this crime. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The total number of victims of trafficking in persons is defined as the total number of victims officially detected by national authorities plus the number of undetected victims of trafficking. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as data on the number of undetected victims is available only for a very limited number of countries and is not regularly monitored, the current computation of the indicator 16.2.2. only focuses on the number of detected victims of trafficking. The count of detected victims of trafficking has the benefit of referring to victims as defined by the UN Protocol, where the act, the mean and the purpose of trafficking have been identified by the national authorities. While information on detected victims can provide valuable information to monitor sex and age profile of detected victims, as well as on forms of exploitation, and trafficking flows, the number of detected victims per se does not monitor the level of trafficking of persons. Interpretation of trends should be done with caution, as changes in detected victims of trafficking can be due to multiple factors such as changes of law enforcement practices, changes in legislation, or changes in trafficking severity or patterns. A decrease over time in a given country may not necessarily reflect a reduced incidence of the crime, but rather a change in detection patterns that may be due to a number of underlying reasons. No clear target can be defined for this indicator until data availability will allow for the inclusion of undetected victims of trafficking. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The numerator of this indicator is composed of two parts: detected and undetected victims of trafficking in persons. The detected part of trafficking victims, as resulting from investigation and prosecution activities of criminal justice system, is counted and reported by national law enforcement authorities. Ideally, the indicator shall be calculated as the ratio between the sum of detected and undetected victims of trafficking over the total population resident in the country, multiplied by 100,000. </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n    <mo>,</mo>\n    <mn>000</mn>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>New methodologies to estimate the number of undetected victims of trafficking in persons are currently being tested.
