During the four reporting cycles to 2015 the HFA Monitor has generated the world&#x2019;s largest repository of information on national DRR policy inter alia. Its successor, provisionally named the Sendai Monitor, is under development and will be informed by the recommendations of the OEIWG. A baseline as of 2015 is expected to be created in 2016-2017 that will facilitate reporting on progress in achieving the relevant targets of both the Sendai Framework and the SDGs.</p>\n<p>Members of both the OEIWG and the IAEG-SDGs have addressed that indicators that simply count the number of countries are not recommended, instead that, indicators to measure progress over time have been promoted. Further to the deliberations of the OEIWG as well as the IAEG, UNISDR has proposed computation methodologies that allow the monitoring of improvement in national and local DRR strategies over time. These methodologies range from a simple quantitative assessment of the number of these strategies to a qualitative measure of alignment with the Sendai Framework, as well as population coverage for local strategies.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Note: Computation methodology for several indicators is very comprehensive, very long (about 180 pages) and probably out of the scope of this Metadata.
