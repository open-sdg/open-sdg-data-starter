For some countries that do not report directly data to FAO, key expenditure aggregates needed to calculate Indicator 2.a.1 are obtained either from the IMF GFS database, from other regional organizations, or from official national governmental websites. </p>\n<p>Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are retrieved from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Data for the denominator are annually collected from countries using the FAO questionnaire on Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA), developed in collaboration with the IMF., For countries with missing information, data is supplemented with data collected by the IMF, regional organizations or published on official national governmental websites.

Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000. Within the FAO&apos;s statistical program of work, member countries endorsed the development of an investment statistics domain, including ongoing work on government expenditure on agriculture, during meetings of three statutory bodies: the Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS) held in Vietnam in February 2014; the African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS) held in Morocco in December 2013; and the IICA working group on agricultural and livestock statistics for Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Trinidad and Tobago in June 2013. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government&#x2019;s orientation to the agriculture sector.</p>\n<p>Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.</p>\n<p>Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and/or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. </p>\n<p>However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe price changes. </p>\n<p>Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.</p>\n<p>An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A&#x2019;s economy is 10 times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take economic size into account. </p>\n<p>An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure fails to take into account the relative contributions of the agricultural sector to a country&#x2019;s GDP. Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 percent to C&#x2019;s GDP, and 10 per cent to country D&#x2019;s GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.</p>\n<p>The AOI index takes into account a country&#x2019;s economic size, Agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. While the indicator does not allow setting of a universal and achievable target, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Since the numerator of this data is based on financial and accounting systems and administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government expenditure data. For the denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.</p>\n<p>The key limitation with this indicator is that Consolidated General Government expenditure &#x2013; the best measure for cross-country comparisons &#x2013; is not available for all reporting countries. While most advanced economies &#x2013; and many emerging market economies &#x2013; do report these data, many smaller and/or low-income economies either do not have significant fiscal interventions in agriculture at the state/provincial and local/municipal levels; or do not have adequate source data to compile meaningful general government estimates for each subsector, as relevant. Given that in several countries, significant intervention in agriculture is implemented by sub-national governments, the Indicator 2.a.1 is calculated using the highest level of government available for the reporting country. For some countries, such as India, where the general government sector is defined for fiscal policy purposes as budgetary central government plus state government, the Indicator will take this into account.</p>\n<p>Annex I lists the reporting countries, their M49 code, the latest year for which data are available and the level of government for which data has been reported. The level of government notation used is as follows: GG: Consolidated General Government; CG Consolidated Central Government (excluding Social Security Funds): CGI: Consolidated Central Government (including Social Security Funds);

Where reported details diverge significantly from the pre-populated aggregates, queries are sent to national counterparts, to ensure the methodological quality, objectivity and reliability of the data submitted by countries.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Data are reported for the highest level of government available (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular basis. In some cases (for example, India and Pakistan), data may reflect the general government sector as per national norm. That is, budgetary central government combined with state government. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>From 2001 forward</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Since this indicator is based on national accounts data and total government expenditures, it does not allow for disaggregation by demographic characteristics or geographic location. However, where countries report expenditure data for the consolidated general government and it subsectors, disaggregation by level of government is possible.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>When in-country compilation errors are identified and FAO has modified government expenditure data reported by countries, or where errors are found in comparison with the IMF GFS COFOG data or fiscal data published on national authorities&apos; websites after querying to national respondents, there may be some difference between data reported by FAO and unrevised national figures.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p>www.fao.org</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>FAOSTAT domain of Government Expenditure on Agriculture
