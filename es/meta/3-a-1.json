In 2010, Conference of the Parties adopted Decision FCTC/COP4(16), which requests the Convention Secretariat, in cooperation with competent authorities within WHO, in particular the Tobacco Free Initiative, to further standardize definitions and indicators and facilitate regular review of progress in implementation of the Convention. See <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop4/FCTC_COP4_DIV6-en.pdf\">https://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop4/FCTC_COP4_DIV6-en.pdf</a> </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of SDG Target 3.a &#x201C;Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate&#x201D;. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this indicator. Information from subnational surveys are not used. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries where other forms of tobacco are also being consumed, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country&#x2019;s perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries&#x2019; definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use. WHO&#x2019;s Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of indicators across countries. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966&#x2013;976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys are compiled into a dataset, the model is fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from countries in the same UN subregion. </p>\n<p>The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. </p>\n<p>Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution. </p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The results of the modelling described in the <em>Method of Computation</em> are compared with the input data to assure a good model fit. The results and input data are shared with countries via the tobacco control focal point for country consultation prior to publication in the biennial reports <em>WHO global report on trends in tobacco use 2000-2025 </em>and<em> WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic</em>.

Where fewer than 50% of a UN subregion&#x2019;s population was surveyed, UN subregions are grouped with neighbouring subregions until at least 50% of the grouped population has contributed data to the region&#x2019;s average rates. </p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Average prevalence rates for regions are calculated by population-weighting the age-specific prevalence rates in countries, then age-standardizing the age-specific average rates of the region. </p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries use a variety of population-based survey protocols to monitor tobacco use at national level.
