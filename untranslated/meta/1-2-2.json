The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds. </p>\n<p>EU countries, North Macedonia and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of &quot;people at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; (AROPE) calculated by EUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of three indicators, and individuals are considered as &quot;at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; if they are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. </p>\n<p>There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>The unit for the indicator 1) and 5) is the percentage of population, while the unit for the indicator 3) is the percentage of households.

href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item-3a-IAEG-SDGs-DataFlowsGuidelines-E.pdf\">Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs</a>, which aim to establish efficient and transparent mechanisms for reporting on SDG data from national to international levels. The guidelines define a framework for national and international agencies to work together to improve the transmission and validation of SDG data at the global level. </p>\n<p>The Statistical Commission sets these guidelines under the overarching Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the Principles Governing International Statistical Activities, emphasizing in particular the principles of transparency, collaboration and communication, and professional and ethical standards. </p>\n<p>The guidelines mandate that SDG indicators be based on data produced and owned by national statistical systems, and that national statistical offices play a central coordinating role in the reporting process. The guidelines outline the roles and responsibilities of entities involved in the compilation of SDG data for global reporting, including National Statistics Offices (NSOs), other national institutions, and international organizations. </p>\n<p>At the national level, the NSO, as coordinator of the National Statistical System, is expected to identify a national data provider for each indicator and liaise between national entities and international custodian agencies. For SDG Indicator 1.2.2, the data provider would be the national entity that is leading the development and monitoring of a measure of national multidimensional poverty recognized as official by the government. </p>\n<p>At the global level, custodian agencies are mandated to compile national SDG indicator data, to harmonize it to ensure quality, international comparability and the computation of regional aggregates, and to report (upload) the data to the Global SDG Indicator Database. In many instances, custodian agencies also support the methodological development of indicators and provide technical assistance to under-resourced national statistical systems. Custodian agencies are expected to publish a timeline of data collection activities, to ensure transparency and sufficient time for NSOs and national data providers to respond to requests for SDG data. </p>\n<p>SDG 1.2.2 is different from other SDG indicators in two important ways. Firstly, it is nationally defined and not a uniform measure across countries, and therefore it is not internationally comparable. Secondly, its custodians are NSOs and not international agencies. Because of these characteristics, UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank collaborate as special partner agencies to provide a platform for compiling national SDG 1.2.2 data and reporting it to the global SDG database, a function typically performed by custodian agencies. While the special partner agencies strive to ensure that reported data is official and of good quality, they do not perform any harmonization or other processing of the data. The Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs also require that national metadata be submitted at the same time as SDG data, to ensure accuracy and international comparability. The variety of methodologies for SDG Indicator 1.2.2 increases the relevance of national metadata as an instrument to ensure high quality and the accuracy of reported data. The three agencies also have extensive portfolios of technical assistance and capacity support to countries for the development of their national measures of multidimensional poverty. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Poverty has traditionally been defined as the lack of money. However, the poor themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time &#x2013; for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty. Therefore, multidimensional poverty measures described above have been developed to create a more comprehensive picture by looking at multiple dimensions such as health, education, living standards. Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population), official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) and multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) are all about the headcount ratio trying to capture how many people, households, or children in the entire pool are regarded as multidimensionally poor. On the other hand, average share of weighted deprivation tries to capture the depth of multidimensional poverty. For instance, if there are 18 indicators to capture different dimensions of poverty, the person who is deprived in 5 indicators, and the person who is deprived in 15 indicators are considered to be both multidimensionally poor. However, the &apos;intensity&apos; of the poverty is different between these two people, which is captured by the average share of weighted deprivation.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The compiled data of SDG 1.2.2 is not intended to be comparable across countries due to the methodological differences. For instance, although both AF methodology and AROPE produce the headcount ratio of people who are considered as &quot;multidimensionally poor&quot;, their definition of multidimensionality is different and cannot be compared. Also, even when countries use the same approach (e.g. AF, AROPE or MODA), the statistics are not always comparable, as key parameters to calculate the measure such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator etc, are tailored to the country specific context. Furthermore, even in the same country, if the methodology is different, the number should not be compared. For instance, if a country calculates its official multidimensional poverty using the AF measure but the child multidimensional poverty using the MODA methodology, the measures could be very different as the dimensions and indicators used in both approaches differ significantly. In this SDG 1.2.2 monitoring, the child multidimensional poverty based on the MODA methodology is reported as a supplementary indicator and the multidimensional poverty rate is reported separately from the disaggregation of the official multidimensional poverty indicator for children. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The measurement of poverty involves two crucial steps: (1) identification &#x2013; identifying who is poor, and (2) aggregation &#x2013; compiling the individual&#x2019;s information into a summary measure. There are different ways to perform these two steps. All measures currently being estimated by countries or multilateral organizations use the counting approach. Therefore, what follows relates only to counting approaches, even if other non-counting methodologies have been developed by experts. </p>\n<p>The identification and aggregation of the multidimensionally poor involves the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Define the set of relevant dimensions of poverty, and for each of these define a set of indicators.</li>\n  <li>For each dimension, determine the criteria to assess deprivation based on the indicators.</li>\n  <li>For each indicator, define a satisfaction threshold, such that a person (or household) with an achievement below the threshold will be identified as deprived in that indicator.</li>\n  <li>For each indicator, compare each person&#x2019;s (or household&#x2019;s) achievement with the satisfaction threshold and create a variable that assumes, for example, the value 1 if the person is deprived in that indicator and 0 otherwise, and then classify them as either deprived or not in that indicator. </li>\n  <li>For each individual (or household), sum up the number of deprivations. In the summation, each indicator can be weighted differently or equally. Typically, if there are more indicators in one dimension than in others, indicator weights are adjusted to ensure equal weights across dimensions, but this need not be the case.</li>\n  <li>Define a poverty cut-off, such that a person exceeding the cut-off will be identified and counted (aggregated) as poor. </li>\n  <li>Aggregate up across individuals (or households) to obtain a measurement of multidimensional poverty for the country or region of interest. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>To illustrate this method, suppose a hypothetical society with five people, where multidimensional poverty is measured based on four indicators: per capita household income, years of schooling, access to sanitation, and access to source of water. The deprivation thresholds for these indicators are, respectively: 400 monetary units (e.g. dollars, pesos, shillings), 5 years of schooling for adults, having access to improved sanitation, and having access to improved sources of water. In this example, the four indicators are weighted equally, and the multidimensional poverty cut-off is two out of the four indicators. That is, the person would be considered poor if she is deprived in at least two out of the four indicators. Table 1 presents the individuals&#x2019; achievements in each of the four relevant indicators, and the deprivation cut-offs are shown in the bottom row. The achievements falling below the deprivation thresholds are highlighted in red. Table 2 shows the deprivation status of all individuals in the four indicators. Column (5) shows the sum of deprivations. Comparing this sum with the poverty cut-off (as mentioned above, two out of four) the individuals can be classified as poor and non-poor, as shown in column (6). </p>\n<p><strong>Table 1.

</tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The last step involves aggregating the information across individuals. The most common summary measure is the headcount ratio or incidence of poverty. The headcount ratio is the proportion of the total population classed as poor. In the example above, the incidence of multidimensional poverty is 60 percent (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>3</mn>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>5</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math>). All empirical examples discussed in this section use the headcount ratio as the core measure of multidimensional poverty. On one hand, this measure is very intuitive and can be disaggregated by population sub-groups. On the other hand, it cannot be broken down by the contributions of each different indicator and it is not sensitive to the number of deprivations experienced by the poor. Because of these limitations, some methodologies propose other summary measures in addition to the headcount ratio. For the purpose of reporting on SDG Indicator 1.2.2, countries only need to compute the headcount ratio. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Unmet Basic Needs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The measures of Unmet Basic Needs (UBN), which proliferated in Latin America in the 1980s, are a direct application of the counting approach.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> These measures often use census data to produce detailed maps of poverty and can also be estimated using household surveys. They identify the poor using the counting approach as described above, following all the steps mentioned, and aggregate the information across households and people using incidence ratios. Most generally, the share of households or individuals with unmet basic needs is presented for different poverty cut-offs &#x2013; that is, the proportion of households and people with one or more unmet basic need, the proportion of households and people with two or more unmet basic needs, and so on. The basic needs considered in these measures usually include (Feres and Mancero, 2001): access to housing that meets minimum housing standards, access to basic services that guarantee minimum sanitary conditions, access to basic education, and economic capacity to achieve minimum consumption levels. When these measures are estimated using census data, they can be highly disaggregated geographically, which makes it possible to construct detailed maps of poverty at district, municipality and even census ratio levels. Because of this property, maps of unmet basic needs have sometimes been used to allocate resources across areas. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Multidimensional Poverty Measurement in Mexico</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The counting approach has been used to assess the number of people that are deprived simultaneously in income and in some non-monetary dimensions.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> Early applications can be found in Ireland, and more recently, in the United Kingdom for measuring child poverty.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> But the first country to develop an official and permanent measure of multidimensional poverty in the developing world was Mexico. The National Council for Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL) led that process. In Mexico, multidimensional poverty is measured in the space of economic well-being and social rights, at the individual level:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A person is considered to be multidimensionally poor when the exercise of at least one of her social rights is not guaranteed and if she also has an income that is insufficient to buy the goods and services required to fully satisfy her needs.&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://www.coneval.org.mx/rw/resource/coneval/med_pobreza/MPMMPingles100903.pdf\">CONEVAL, 2010</a>) </p>\n<p><strong>Table 3: Dimensions and indicators of the measure of multidimensional poverty of Mexico</strong></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Type of Dimension</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Dimension</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Indicator</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Economic well-being</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Economic well-being</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Income per capita</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">\n        <p>Social rights</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Education</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Educational gap (meeting a minimum level of education for their age cohort)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Health</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Enrolled in the Social Health Protection System</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Social security</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Access to social security</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Housing </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Quality and spaces of dwelling (floor, roof, walls, and overcrowding)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Services in the dwelling</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Access to basic services in dwelling (water, drainage, electricity, cooking fuel)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Food</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Food security</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All persons whose income per capita is insufficient to cover necessary goods and services are considered deprived in economic well-being. For social rights, each of the six indicators in Table 3 is generated as a binary variable, with 1 representing deprivation, and 0 otherwise. In the cases in which there is more than one indicator, that is, for housing and access to services in the dwelling, the individual is classified as deprived if she fails to meet the threshold for any single indicator within the dimension. The social deprivation index is then defined as the sum of these six indicators associated with social deprivation. The six dimensions are equally weighted, as all human rights are considered equally important. The social deprivation index thus takes a value between zero (the person is not deprived in any of the six social rights indicators) and six (the individual is deprived in all of them).</p>\n<p>The classification of the population according to this method is illustrated in Figure <strong>1</strong>1. The vertical axis represents the space of economic well-being, measured by per capita household income. The horizontal axis represents the space of social rights. In this axis, individuals at the origin have a social deprivation index of six, individuals placed more to the right have fewer deprivations. The deprivation cutoff in the space of social rights is one, and individuals to the left of this threshold or on this threshold are considered to be deprived in social rights. People are divided into four groups (CONEVAL 2010, p. 32):</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><em>Multidimensionally poor</em>. People with an income below the economic well-being threshold and with one or more unfulfilled social rights.</li>\n  <li><em>Vulnerable due to social deprivation</em>. Socially deprived people with an income higher than the economic well-being threshold.</li>\n  <li><em>Vulnerable due to income</em>. Population with no social deprivations and with an income below the economic well-being threshold.</li>\n  <li><em>Not multidimensionally poor and not vulnerable</em>.

Adapted of CONEVAL (2010).</p>\n<p>Among the multidimensionally poor, those in extreme poverty are also identified, by considering a lower economic well-being threshold (the minimum economic well-being threshold)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup> and a higher deprivation threshold of three or more social deprivations. </p>\n<p>In terms of aggregation, Mexico produces several categories of summary measures. The core measure is the headcount ratio, that is, the proportion of people who are multidimensionally poor (i.e. the proportion of people in group I in 1). In addition, other headcount measures are also reported, such as the proportion of people deprived in economic well-being, the proportion deprived in each of the social rights, and the proportion showing one or more social deprivations. The depth of poverty is computed separately with respect to economic well-being and social deprivations. The depth of poverty in terms of economic well-being is the average gap between the well-being threshold and the income of poor people.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup> This measure is reported for groups I and III in 1. The depth of poverty in terms of social deprivations is the average proportion of deprivations among those suffering at least one deprivation. This measure is reported for groups I and II in Figure 1. Finally, the intensity of poverty corresponds to the product of the headcount ratio and the depth of poverty.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup> This measure is computed for the multidimensionally poor (group I) and the socially deprived (group II).</p>\n<p>In 2015, Vietnam launched their official multidimensional poverty index, following an approach similar to the one adopted in Mexico but using the household as the unit of analysis. A multidimensionally poor household is a household (1) whose monthly average income per capita is at or below income-based poverty line, OR (2) whose monthly average income per capita is above income-based poverty line but below minimum living standard AND is deprived on at least 3 indices for measuring deprivation of access to basic social services. Ten indicators are included in the list of basic social services. These are (1) adult education, (2) child school attendance, (3) accessibility to health care services, (4) health insurance, (5) quality of house, (6) housing area per capita, (7) drinking water supply, (8) hygienic toilet/latrine, (9) use of telecommunication services, and (10) assets for information accessibility.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></sup></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>At Risk of Poverty or Social Exclusion</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since 2010, the European Union&#x2019;s economic strategy set the headline target on poverty for 2020 to &#x201C;20 million less people should be at risk of poverty.&#x201D; Progress against this target is measured with the rate of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:At_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion_(AROPE)\">AROPE</a>), defined as the proportion of people that are either at risk of monetary poverty, or are living in a household with very low work intensity, or are severely materially deprived. In other words, AROPE considers three dimensions/indicators, and the individual is at risk of poverty or social exclusion if she is deprived in at least one of those dimensions/indicators. </p>\n<p>An individual is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:At-risk-of-poverty_rate\">at-risk-of-poverty</a> if:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>She has an equivalized disposable income (after social transfers) below 60 percent of the national median equivalized disposable income after social transfers. </li>\n  <li>Lives in a household with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Persons_living_in_households_with_low_work_intensity\">very low work intensity</a> (i.e. if the ratio of the total number of months that all working-age household members have worked during the income reference year to the total number of months they theoretically could have worked is less than 20 percent). </li>\n  <li>Is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Severe_material_deprivation_rate\">severely materially deprived</a>, that is if she cannot afford at least four of the following nine items:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <li>to pay the rent, mortgage or utility bills</li>\n  <li>to keep the home adequately warm</li>\n  <li>to face unexpected expenses</li>\n  <li>to eat meat or proteins regularly</li>\n  <li>to go on holiday</li>\n  <li>a television set</li>\n  <li>a washing machine</li>\n  <li>a car</li>\n  <li>a telephone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information on the individuals at risk of poverty and social exclusion is aggregated in the form of an incidence rate, the proportion of individuals in the total population that are identified as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion.</p>\n<p>The construction of AROPE follows the same steps outlined above that are used in the UBN or mixed (CONEVAL) experiences. In addition, as in the two other highlighted cases, the three dimensions are equally weighted. However, while CONEVAL takes as deprived in social rights as those suffering from at least one deprivation in any indicator within this dimension, AROPE requires that within material deprivation at least four deprivations out of nine are needed for establishing severe material deprivation.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Alkire-Foster Approach to Multidimensional Poverty </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alkire and Foster presented a family of multidimensional poverty measures based on the counting approach, which has captured global attention and is being widely adopted by countries. The first and most well-known application is the UNDP-OPHI Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at the global level, which has been published since 2011. Since then, many countries have followed their guidance in what is known as &#x201C;the MPI approach.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>The Alkire-Foster family of measures follows the five steps of counting approaches described above and the two stages of identification and aggregation: (1) there is a first cut-off for each deprivation-specific threshold, and (2) there is second cut-off at the aggregation stage to determine whether the person (or household) is multidimensionally poor based on the deprivation score. Differential weights are sometimes used at the aggregation stage, but they are not mandatory. This results in an estimate of the incidence or prevalence of poverty, which is usually referred as H.</p>\n<p>An innovation introduced by the Alkire-Foster family of measures is that it is possible to account simultaneously for both the incidence of poverty (H), as well as its intensity (A).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup> The intensity of poverty &#x2013; also called breadth of poverty &#x2013; is defined as the average proportion of the relevant multidimensional poverty indicators (weighted or not) in which the poor are deprived. When using categorical variables, it is possible to estimate an adjusted headcount ratio (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>0</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> or MPI), where </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>0</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>H</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n  </math><em>.</em></p>\n<p>The adjusted headcount ratio, just like the other measures described in this note, can be disaggregated by population subgroups (e.g. geographic area, ethnicity), and it can be broken down by dimension or indicator. For more details on the methodology, see Alkire et al. (2015). </p>\n<p>The Alkire-Foster approach can be seen as a general framework to measure multidimensional poverty that can be tailored to very different contexts. Many of the existing permanent national statistics of multidimensional poverty are based on the global MPI, but with substantial modifications in terms of dimensions, indicators, and thresholds.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup> Since 2018, the World Bank regularly presents multidimensional poverty measures across countries using the headcount ratio (H), as is done by UNDP-OPHI measure, albeit with differences in the selection of parameters, some of the indicators, and sources of data. <strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong> in the annex presents a comparison of indicators used in both global measures. In addition to the headcount ratio, the 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, where the World Bank introduced this multidimensional measure, presents estimates of global poverty using the adjusted headcount ratio of the Alkire-Foster family as well as the distribution-sensitive multidimensional poverty measure, proposed in Datt (2018). </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Child Poverty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Children experience and suffer poverty differently than adults. Their needs are also different, for example in terms of nutrition or education. However, children are often invisible in poverty estimates. That is why the SDG 1.2.2 explicitly mentions children and why countries should establish a child-specific measure of child poverty. The European Conference of Statisticians recommends that countries &#x201C;develop child-specific and life-cycle adapted multidimensional poverty measures&#x201D; (Recommendation 29). </p>\n<p>If child-specific poverty measures are not developed, there is a risk of misinterpreting the evolving situation of children and consequently misinterpreting the impact of policies and external shocks. It is possible that while the situation of children in a given household deteriorates, that household becomes &#x201C;non-poor&#x201D; due to indicators that matter only for adults. In such a case, despite the fact that these children are worse-off than they were before, they would no longer be counted as poor. </p>\n<p>Over 70 low- and middle-income countries which have carried out child poverty analyses based on a child-specific measure of child poverty use the child as the unit of analysis. These countries are in all regions of the developing world, (e.g. Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia), as well as in the European Union.</p>\n<p>Estimating multidimensional child poverty follows the same steps as the other examples mentioned above: the relevant dimensions are identified, criteria to assess deprivation in each dimension are established, and deprived children in each dimension are identified. A threshold is then specified concerning the minimum number of dimensions in which a child must be deprived to be considered poor, and children above or below this threshold are then counted. Moreover, the percentage (and number) of children deprived in exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, et cetera, deprivations are reported and analyzed, as well as the overlaps or simultaneous deprivations. This makes it possible to measure the incidence, the breadth, and the severity of poverty in a simple and integrated way.</p>\n<p>For child poverty, the selection of dimensions should be based on child rights. However, not all rights constitute child poverty, as explained in the Guidelines on Human Rights and Poverty from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. According to the Conference of European Statisticians: &#x201C;Deprivation measures need to be based upon a clear and explicit theory or normative definition of poverty in order to ensure that each indicator is a valid measure, i.e. that <strong>it measures poverty and not some other related (or unrelated) concept such as wellbeing [sic] or happiness</strong>&#x201D; (Recommendation 28 (a), emphasis added).</p>\n<p>As in the case of CONEVAL (explicitly) and UBN (implicitly), no differential weights should be applied across dimensions because they are rights. All rights are equally important and cannot be substituted. This is not just emanating from the human rights approach, but it is also the case with capabilities approach, as stated by Dixon and Nussbaum (2012): &#x201C;A Capabilities Approach is generally committed to the equal protection of rights for all up to a certain threshold. Any trade-off that leaves some people below this threshold will thus be a clear failure of basic justice under a Capabilities Approach&#x201D; (Children&#x2019;s Rights and a Capabilities Approach: The Question of Special Priority, p. 554, Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper No. 384.)</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> This approach was proposed in several publications before being adopted widely in Latin America.

Thus regional and global aggregates are not produced.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>A successful measure of multidimensional poverty should be rigorous, institutionalized, sustainable, and useful. Such a measure generates credible and relevant information, and it is established as an official permanent statistic alongside traditional ones such as the income or expenditure poverty headcount and poverty gaps. As with other indicators, it is important that a clear and transparent system be in place for the regular updating of the measurement. This implies that the responsibility for these updates is assigned to an official entity and that associated costs are incorporated in the government&#x2019;s budget. Ideally, a multidimensional poverty measure could be used actively to guide policy-making (e.g. policies coordination, targeting, and policy evaluation). </p>\n<p>To make such a measure institutional and useful, it is fundamental for the government to own the process. Having the support of high-level representatives within the government, such as the president or prime minister, or ministers, grants additional legitimacy to the process and may facilitate the adoption of the measure by other levels of government and stakeholders. In addition, a high-level official may be able to bring other relevant actors into the design process and work on the institutionalization of the measure. The active participation of different ministries in the discussions and decisions throughout the process of design, namely the selection of indicators, respective cut-offs, and weights, is essential to ensure that the final measure meets the needs of policy makers in a specific country context.</p>\n<p>To make a measure long-lasting, rather than specific to a particular administration, it is useful to build consensus and a shared sense of legitimacy around the measure that transcends individual political actors. This requires that the process of developing the measure is perceived as credible, transparent, and non-partisan. Engaging key stakeholders, such as academics, opinion leaders, the opposition, and civil society representatives throughout the process is highly desirable. This should include wide consultations with the public, for example through nationally representative surveys to capture the national consensus about the minima required to satisfy different dimensions. In addition, it is important to have a well-designed communication strategy to explain the concept and the process to these different actors, allowing for channels for them to participate in the discussions about the design of the measure. Some countries have opted for involving a poverty committee that gathers experts and representatives from different sectors of society in the decision process of designing the measure. </p>\n<p>More specifically, the design of a measure of multidimensional poverty generally involves a technical process, complemented and supported by a political process. If both technical and political committees are set up, it is useful to agree on: (1) a plan of activities and timeline; (2) a schedule of regular interactions to ensure good communication; and (3) a documentation system that keeps track of all decisions and respective rationales. However, political interference in the technical process should be avoided, as recommended by the UNSD National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics.</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The data has been validated by a three-stage approach to assure its accuracy.

</tbody>\n</table>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Comparability:</strong></p>\n<p>The compiled data of SDG 1.2.2 are not intended to be comparable across countries due to the methodological differences. For instance, although both AF methodology and AROPS produce the headcount ratio of people who are considered as &quot;multidimensionally poor&quot;, their definition of multidimensionality is different and cannot be compared. Also, even when countries use the same approach (e.g. AF, AROPE or MODA), the statistics are not always comparable, as key parameters to calculate the measure such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator etc, are tailored to the country specific context. Furthermore, even in the same country, if the methodology is different, the number should not be compared. For instance, if a country calculates its official multidimensional poverty using the AF measure but the child multidimensional poverty using the MODA methodology, the measures could be very different as the dimensions and indicators used in both approaches differ significantly. In this SDG 1.2.2 monitoring, the child multidimensional poverty based on the MODA methodology is reported as a supplementary indicator and the multidimensional poverty rate is reported separately from the disaggregation of the official multidimensional poverty indicator for children.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>UNDP produces global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which is the product of multiplying multidimensional headcount and average number of deprivations using the same dimension and indicators covering more than 100 countries. However, most of these numbers are not officially approved by each country, and sometimes the nationally calculated MPI is different from the global MPI due to some difference of the parameters, therefore, in this platform, we are not reporting the global MPI.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p><strong>Country</strong></p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Reference</p>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Official publication: https://www.nsia.gov.af:8080/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/A-MPI-2019-full-report-English-1.pdf;
