It is a territorial (production side) indicator. DMC also presents the amount of material that needs to be handled within an economy, which is either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure or used to fuel the economy as material throughput. It describes the physical dimension of economic processes and interactions. It can also be interpreted as long-term waste equivalent.
