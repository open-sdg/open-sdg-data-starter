La l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional se fija actualmente en 1,90 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda a precios internacionales de 2011.\n\n## Conceptos:\nAl evaluar la pobreza en un pa\u00eds determinado y la mejor manera de reducirla, naturalmente uno se enfoca en una l\u00ednea de pobreza que se considera apropiada para ese pa\u00eds. Pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo hablamos de manera significativa sobre \"la pobreza global\"? Las l\u00edneas de pobreza entre pa\u00edses var\u00edan en t\u00e9rminos de su poder adquisitivo y tienen un fuerte gradiente econ\u00f3mico, de modo que los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s ricos tienden a adoptar niveles de vida m\u00e1s altos al definir la pobreza. Pero para medir consistentemente la pobreza absoluta global en t\u00e9rminos de consumo, necesitamos tratar a dos personas con el mismo poder adquisitivo sobre los productos b\u00e1sicos de la misma manera - ambos son pobres o no lo son - incluso si viven en pa\u00edses diferentes.\n\nDesde el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, el Banco Mundial se ha propuesto aplicar un est\u00e1ndar com\u00fan para medir la pobreza extrema, anclado en lo que significa la pobreza en los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s pobres del mundo. El bienestar de las personas que viven en diferentes pa\u00edses se puede medir en una escala com\u00fan ajustando las diferencias en el poder adquisitivo de las monedas. Para el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, se eligi\u00f3 el est\u00e1ndar de 1 d\u00f3lar al d\u00eda, medido a precios internacionales de 1985 y ajustado a la moneda local mediante PPA, porque era t\u00edpico de las l\u00edneas de pobreza de los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos en ese momento. A medida que evolucionan las diferencias en el costo de vida en todo el mundo, la l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional debe actualizarse peri\u00f3dicamente utilizando nuevos datos de precios de PPA para reflejar estos cambios. El \u00faltimo cambio fue en octubre de 2015, cuando el Banco Mundial adopt\u00f3 $ 1,90 como l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional utilizando la PPA de 2011. Antes de eso, la actualizaci\u00f3n de 2008 estableci\u00f3 la l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional en $ 1,25 utilizando la PPA de 2005. Las medidas de pobreza basadas en l\u00edneas de pobreza internacionales intentan mantener constante el valor real de la l\u00ednea de pobreza en todos los pa\u00edses, como se hace al hacer comparaciones en el tiempo. Las primeras ediciones de los Indicadores de desarrollo mundial (WDI) del Banco Mundial' utilizaban las PPA de las Penn World Tables para convertir los valores en moneda local al poder adquisitivo equivalente medido en d\u00f3lares estadounidenses. En ediciones posteriores se utilizaron estimaciones de la PPA de consumo de 1993, 2005 y 2011 elaboradas por el Programa de Comparaci\u00f3n Internacional (PCI) del Banco Mundial'.","UNIT_MEASURE":"","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":""},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-05-17","national_data_updated_date":"2018-10-20","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 1.1: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 1.1.1: Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line by sex, age, employment status and geographic location (urban/rural)</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"<p>Employed population below international poverty line (%)</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"2023-03-31","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"<p>1.3.1, 8.2.1, 8.3.1, 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 10.4.1</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"<p>International Labour Organization (ILO)</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"<p>International Labour Organization (ILO)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is defined as the share of employed persons living in households with per-capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.90.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>Employment: All persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</p>\n<p>Poverty Line: Threshold below which individuals in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are considered non-poor.

The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed population living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift them and their families out of poverty and ensure decent living conditions. The adequacy of earnings is a fundamental aspect of job quality, and these deficits in job quality could be keeping workers and their families in poverty.</p>\n<p>The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light on the relationship between employment and household poverty.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such factors as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the same degree of need.</p>\n<p>Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to households, and not to individuals, based on the assumption that households pool their income. This assumption may not always be true.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the poverty status of a household is a function of the wage and other employment-related income secured by those household members in employment, income derived from asset ownership, plus any other available income such as transfer payments and the number of household members. Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her own income, the income of other household members and the number of household members who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to study household structure in relation to working poverty. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">W</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">k</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">v</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">E</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">v</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">h</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">U</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mo>.</mo>\n        <mn>90</mn>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with Member States through the ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).
