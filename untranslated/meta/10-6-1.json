The indicator is not intended for use at country-level or for cross-country comparisons.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The computation uses each institutions&#x2019; own published membership and voting rights data from their respective annual reports. The ratio of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights allocated to developing countries (as classified by the &#x201C;historical&#x201D; classification of &#x201C;Developed regions&#x201D; and &#x201C;Developing regions&#x201D; as of December 2021 in the United Nations M49 statistical standard), divided by the total number of voting rights.
