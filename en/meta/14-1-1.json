Coastal eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital sea habitats, and can cause the spread of harmful algal blooms. SDG Indicator 14.1.1a aims to measure the contribution to coastal eutrophication from countries and the state of coastal eutrophication.</p>\n<p>Eutrophication is an excess nutrient loading into coastal environments from anthropogenic sources, resulting in excessive growth of plants, algae and phytoplankton. The basis for these loads is collected from land-based assessments of land use including fertilizer use, population density, socioeconomic factors and other contributors to nutrient pollution runoff. Given the land-based nature of the indicator, it provides a modelled number indicating the risk of coastal eutrophication at a specific river mouth.</p>\n<p>One more important characteristic is Chlorophyll-a deviation. Chlorophyll-a concentrations for this indicator are obtained from the global ocean, 4 km spatial resolution per pixel monthly mean product of the OC-CCI project product for each pixel within the country&#x2019;s territorial sea and exclusive economic zone.</p>\n<p>Territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline of a coastal state, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>\n<p>The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea.

With over 40 percent of the human population residing in coastal areas, ecosystem degradation in these areas can have disproportionate effects on society (IGOS, 2006).

Coastal eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital sea habitats, and can cause the spread of harmful algal blooms. </p>\n<p>Marine litter is found in all the world&#x2019;s oceans and seas. It constitutes an increasing risk to ecosystem health and biodiversity while entailing substantial economic costs through its impacts on public health, tourism, fishing and aquaculture. Marine plastics are of particular interest due to the fact that in the last 50 years, plastic production has increased more than 22-fold while the global recycling rate of plastics in 2015 was only an estimated 9%. This rise in plastic production and unmanaged plastic waste has resulted a growing threat to marine environments with an estimated 5-13 million tons of plastic from land-based sources ending up in marine environments.</p>\n<p>Target 14.1 aims to reduce the impacts of pollution through prevention and reduction of marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data and other data sources which will be validated by countries.

Following a decade long break in observations, there has been continuous satellite ocean colour since 1997 with SeaWiFS, followed by MERIS, MODIS (Terra, Aqua), VIIRS (NPP, N20) and now OLCI (S-3A, S-3B). Data gaps from individual sensors are common due to revisit cycles, cloud cover, and spurious retrievals resulting from a host of confounding atmospheric and aquatic conditions. This issue has been addressed by combining data from multiple sensors and creating a consistent, merged ocean colour product (e.g., chlorophyll-a). The ESA Ocean Colour CCI (OC-CCI) project, led by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), has produced a consistent, merged chlorophyll-a product from SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS and VIIRS, spanning 1997 to 2018 (Sathyendranath et al., 2018). A merged multi-sensor product will be updated in both time and with data from additional sensors (e.g., OLCI) under a forthcoming EUMETSAT initiative that will continue the time series on an operational basis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For SDG 14.1.1a, Chlorophyll-a (4 km resolution, monthly products) will be derived from the OC-CCI project is generated for each individual pixel within the country&#x2019;s territorial sea and EEZ.

Pixels with differences from the baseline that are in the 90th percentile of values &gt;0 across the cumulative global EEZ and territorial sea. The percentage of pixels in a country&#x2019;s EEZ and territorial sea that are identified as deviating from the baseline (falling in the 90th percentile) will be calculated for each national EEZ and territorial sea by month. The annual average of these monthly values is then calculated.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em><u>Level 2: In situ monitoring of nutrients</u></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where national capacity to do so exists, national level measurements of Chlorophyll-a and other parameters (including nitrogen, phosphate and silica) (in situ or from remote sensing), should be used to complement and ground truth global remote sensing and modelled data and enable a more detailed assessment of eutrophication. In particular, monitoring of supplementary eutrophication parameters is advisable to determine whether an increase in Chlorophyll-a concentration is directly linked to an anthropogenic increase in nutrients. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em><u>Level 2: National ICEP modelling</u></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Existing ICEP modelling at the national level is limited, but could be further developed following the model of a current study analysing basin level data in Chinese rivers (Strokal et al 2016). The study utilises Global NEWS &#x2013; 2 (Nutrient Export from WaterSheds) and Nutrient flows in Food chains, Environment and Resources use (NUFER) as models. The Global NEWS-2 model is basin-scale and quantifies river export of various nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and silica) in multiple forms (dissolved inorganic, dissolved organic and particulate) as functions of human activities on land and basin characteristics (Strokal et al 2016). Furthermore, the model shows past and future trends.</p>\n<p><strong>For 14.1.1b &#x201C;Plastic debris density&#x201D;:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em><u>Level 1: Plastic patches greater than 10 meters</u></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Satellite-based global data products make up the statistics for this indicator.

National efforts to collect data on beach litter can be supported by campaigns to engage members of the public as volunteers in beach clean-ups (see for example the Ocean Conservancy&#x2019;s International Coastal Clean-up (ICC) initiative) or citizen science programmes (see for example NOAA&#x2019;s Marine Debris Monitoring and Assessment Citizen Science Project). Specific instructions on how to conduct citizen science beach surveys are included in the GESAMP Guidelines (GESAMP 2019). </p>\n<p>Beyond the tools used to conduct beach litter monitoring, it is important to consider the timing of surveys in order to properly plan effective surveys. The GESAMP Guidelines explain two main types of surveying beaches including rapid assessment surveys and routine shoreline monitoring. Rapid assessment surveys are best conducted in response to natural disasters, to build a baseline for future surveys and/or to identify beach litter hotspots.</p>\n<p>The average count of plastic items can be computed for each area sampled. A geospatial model is recommended in order to estimate the density across the coastline and to establish a national average.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The data validation for this indicator will differ according to the level classification of the indicator measured:</p>\n<p>For Level 1 data: All globally estimated or modelled data will be shared with national statistical offices and other relevant authorities for in-country validation and replacement with national data if possible.</p>\n<p>For Level 2 data: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Regional Seas will be carried out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data. Communication will be carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the validation process will be reported by UNEP on the Global SDG Database. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>No adjustments are made</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p>For Level 1 data: Not applicable.</p>\n<p>For Level 2 data: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Regional Seas do not make any estimation or imputation for missing values, so the number of data points provided are actual country data. </p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>The data are aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global levels.

Similarly, the underlying national nutrient data which feeds into national or global ICEP modelling may include discrepancies (for example, in some cases different national ministries maintain data on fertilizer, wastewater, etc.). It is recommended that national statistical systems review and work to eliminate discrepancies in the underlying data for these indictors.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>References: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/regional-seas-programme\">Regional Seas Programme website</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/35086\">Understanding the State of the Ocean: A Global Manual on Measuring SDG 14.1.1, SDG 14.2.1 and SDG 14.5.1</a> (UNEP, 2021) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/marine_plastics/une_science_dvision_gesamp_reports.pdf\">Guidelines for the Monitoring and Assessment of Plastic Litter in the Ocean</a> (GESAMP, 2019) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/26440/MSP_ICZM_Guidelines.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">Conceptual guidelines for the application of Marine Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management approaches to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal Targets 14.1 and 14.2</a> (UNEP, 2018)</p>","target_number":"14.1","goal_number":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-01-01"}
