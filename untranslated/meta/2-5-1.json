As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.</p>\n<p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>\n<p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Information on cryo-conserved material in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be updated on a regular base.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds and transboundary breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm</a>).
