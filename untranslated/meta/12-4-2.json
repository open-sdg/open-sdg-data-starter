Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial manufacturing process waste to domestic items such as batteries and may come in many forms, including liquids, solids, gases and sludge. They can be discarded as commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides or the by-products of manufacturing processes, from Basel Convention (Article 1, paragraph 1(a)). Waste listed in Annex VIII of the Basel Convention is presumed to be hazardous, while waste listed in Annex IX is presumed not to be hazardous. For the purpose of this indicator, due to comparability reasons, additional waste considered hazardous as per national definitions, as provided by the Basel Convention under Article 1, paragraph 1 (b), are excluded.</p>\n<p><em>Hazardous waste generated</em> refers to the quantity of hazardous waste (as per the definition above) that is generated within the country during the reported year, prior to any activity such as collection, preparation for reuse, treatment, recovery, including recycling, or export, no matter the destination of this waste. In case waste that are not covered under the above definition, but are defined as, or are considered to be hazardous waste by national definitions are included in the &#x201C;hazardous waste generated&#x201D; amount, a specific note should be added specifying the additional types/streams of hazardous waste included as well as their quantities. </p>\n<p>The hazardous waste generated should be reported as a total amount generated during the year, as well as by its distribution among wide categories of economic activities and by households.

There are over 140,000 different substances used in all economic sectors globally. Their benefits are many and so too are their potential to adversely impact human health and the environment if not properly managed. All countries, but especially developing countries and economies in transition, are facing the complex challenge of managing hazardous waste according to international standards of good practice. The situation is complicated by limited human, financial and/or technical resources. As such, action is needed to support the sustainable use of chemicals and environmentally sound management of hazardous waste. There is also a rapid increase in the generation of hazardous waste. Where most of the conventional hazardous wastes are produced in industrial and manufacturing operations, significant amounts are generated in non-industrial sectors, including sludge from the healthcare sector; waste-water treatment plants, waste oils, and waste batteries. There is also an increase in the complexity of products and unidentified hazardous components like coatings, and/or items which are not hazardous (laminates and multi-layer packaging), but present hazardousness in a variety of ways when improperly discarded and end up in air, water or are burned.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on hazardous waste generation and treatment may be scarce in some countries, due to a series of factors, such as lack of, or insufficient, policies and regulations on management and/or reporting; limited human, financial and technical resources within government agencies, lack of clear disclosure and reporting rules and requirements, and unwillingness of generators and public officials in certain countries to disclose the quantities of hazardous waste generated. Some countries may have the data and monitoring systems needed to report, while for others there is a need for training and capacity development to enhance data collection, validation and reporting capacity. </p>\n<p>Limitations in terms of usable data for calculating the indicator(s) may arise due to differences in the way of understanding the terminology used in the indicator or differences between these definitions and the definitions included in national legislation. This can lead to differences in reported values and difficulties in cross-checking of reported data. For example, by national legislation, countries may define additional types of waste to be considered as hazardous beyond the waste streams defined in the Basel Convention.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, &#x201C;Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document (UNEP, forthcoming)&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this indicator, </p>\n<p>Hazardous waste generated should include collected hazardous waste (either by specialized companies or by municipal services), hazardous waste which is given by the generator directly to the treatment or disposal facility, as well as an estimation of the hazardous waste which is unaccounted for.

procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data.
