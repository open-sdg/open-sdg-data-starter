However, direct bribery experiences of the respondent can include instances where the giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service is done through someone else (e.g. middlemen).

Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when administrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule of law, democratic processes and justice.

However, several historical and on-going survey programmes implemented at the national and international level do not include experiences of bribery refusal in the formulation and prevalence computation. It is expected that data according to the preferred definition (which includes bribery refusal) will become increasingly available at national and global level, as standardised question wording and indicator computation are applied.</p>\n<p>On a more general level, it should be noted that this indicator provides information on the experiences of bribery occurring during interactions between citizens and the public sector, while it does not cover other forms of corruption, such as &#xB4;grand corruption&#xB4;, trading in influence, or abuse of power.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of persons who paid at least one bribe to a public official (or were asked for a bribe) in the last 12 months, over the total number of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period, multiplied by 100.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>B</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>b</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>c</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>B</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where <em>B</em> refers to the number of people who paid a bribe to or were asked for a bribe by public official in the last 12 months, and <em>C </em>refers to the total number of people who had contact with public officials in the last 12 months.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Following the submission of the CTS questionnaire, UNODC checks the submitted data for consistency and coherence with other data sources.
