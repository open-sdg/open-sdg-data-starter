When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the manufacturing sector (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion per unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, the structure of the manufacturing sector, the energy efficiency of production technologies in each sub-sector and the economic value of the various output. Manufacturing industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. </p>\n<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from the manufacturing processes. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data is not systematized in many countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy data collected at national level.
