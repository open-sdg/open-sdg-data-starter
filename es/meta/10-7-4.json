It also explicitly states that Member States resolve to take further effective measures and actions, to &#x201C;<em>strengthen support and meet the special needs of people living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies</em>&#x201D;. In addition, target 10.7 recognizes for the first time the contribution of migration to sustainable development by aiming to &#x201C;facilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies&#x201D;.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This indicator tracks the number of people displaced across national borders as a result of persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or events seriously disturbing public order.
