Typical conditions like these form the basis of an experience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods rooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute theoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity.

The standardization process ensures that the mean and standard deviation of the set of common items is the same when measured on the global FIES or on the national scale. Compatibility with the global FIES and the possibility to compile this indicator requires that at least four of the eight FIES items are identified as common.</p>\n<p>The Statistics Division at FAO has developed the RM.weights package under R, which provides routines for estimating the parameters of the Rasch model using conditional maximum likelihood, with the possibility to allow for the complex survey design.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Face-to-face and telephone interviews within national surveys.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Continuing</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>July 2021 </p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National data providers will be the National Statistical Authorities that are responsible for the survey in which the FIES or similar scale is included.

As such, high prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered a predictor of various forms of diet-related health conditions in the population, associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. Severe levels of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high probability of reduced food intake and therefore can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition, including hunger.</p>\n<p>Short questionnaires like the FIES are very easy to administer at limited cost, which is one of the main advantages of their use. The ability to precisely determine the food insecurity status of specific individuals or households, however, is limited by the small number of questions, a reason why assignment of individual respondents to food insecurity classes is best done in probability terms, thus ensuring that estimates of prevalence rates in a population are sufficiently reliable even when based on relatively small sample sizes. </p>\n<p>As with any statistical assessment, reliability and precision crucially depend on the quality of the survey design and implementation. One major advantage of the analytic treatment of the data through the Rasch model based methods is that it permits testing the quality of the data collected and evaluating the likely margin of uncertainty around estimated prevalence rates, which should always be reported.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>An average of less than three minutes of survey time is estimated to collect FIES data in a well-conducted face-to-face survey, which should make it possible to include the FIES-SM in a nationally representative survey in every country in the world, at a very reasonable cost. FAO provides versions of the FIES-SM adapted and translated in each of the more than 200 languages and dialects used in the Gallup World Poll.</p>\n<p>When used in the Gallup World Poll, with sample sizes of only about 1000 individuals, the width of confidence intervals rarely exceeds 20% of the measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of around 50% are estimated with margins of errors of plus or minus 5%). Obviously, confidence intervals are likely to be much smaller when national prevalence rates are estimated using larger samples.</p>\n<p>Compared to other proposed non-official indicators of household food insecurity, the FIES based approach has the advantage that food insecurity prevalence rates are directly comparable across population groups and countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as &#x201C;mild&#x201D;, &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; and &#x201C;severe&#x201D; food insecurity) other approaches have yet to demonstrate the formal comparability of the thresholds used for classification, due to lack of the definition of a proper statistical model that links the values of the &#x201C;indexes&#x201D; or &#x201C;scores&#x201D; used for classification, to the severity of food insecurity. For this reason, care should be taken when comparing the results obtained with the FIES with those obtained with these other indicators, even if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to describe them.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey.

For the calculation of the indicator 2.1.2, objective is to produce a prevalence of individuals. This implies that:</p>\n<p>if a survey is at household level, and provides household sampling weights, they should be transformed to individual sampling weights by multiplying the weights by the household size. This individual weighting system can then be used to calculate the individual prevalence rates in formulas (1) and (2)</p>\n<p>If the survey includes only adults, then the adult weights applied to the probabilities in formulas (1) and (2) provide the adult prevalence rates (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>F</mi>\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n  </math>). In this case, to calculate the prevalence in the total population, then the proportion of children who live in households where at least one adult is food insecure must also be calculated. This can be done by dividing the adult weights by the number of adults in the household and multiplying those approximate household weights by the number of children in the household. Once the approximate child weights are obtained, the prevalence of food insecurity of children who live in households where at least one adult is food insecure (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>F</mi>\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n  </math>) can be calculated by applying these weights to the probabilities of food insecurity in formulas (1) and (2).

household characteristics such as location, household income, composition (including for example presence and number of small children, members with disabilities, elderly members, etc.), sex, age and education of the household head, etc. If applied at the individual level, proper disaggregation of the prevalence of food insecurity by sex is possible as the prevalence of food insecurity among male and among female members of the same population group can be measured independently.</p>\n<p>When producing disaggregated statistics, attention must be devoted to verifying the validity of the application by estimating the Rasch model with the data from each specific subpopulation group and, if necessary, perform the appropriate equating of the measure before comparing results.</p>\n<p>It

See Annex I and Table A3 in http://www.fao.org/3/i4830e.pdf for a description of the differences.
