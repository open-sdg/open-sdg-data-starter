However, it does not include the processing or preserving of fish when it occurs in land-based facilities.</p>\n<p>A <u>fish stock</u> is a subset of a species (fish, crustacean, mollusc, etc.) or a population inhabiting a geographical area and participating in the same reproductive process.</p>\n<p><u>Maximum sustainable yield (MSY)</u> is the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken (on average) from a stock under existing (average) environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process.

For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011).</p>\n<p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress.

The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus measures sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance with the agreed indicator formulation.</p>\n<p>The share of value added from an industry in GDP is commonly used as an indication of its economic importance. Accordingly, the value added of marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine fish related activities in the country&#x2019;s economy and its importance for livelihoods. Both GDP and the VA are measured in constant prices and domestic currency.</p>\n<p>Stocks that are fished at sustainable levels are able to support the communities and industries which rely on them, without compromising reproduction and long-term sustainability. By contrast, a stock that is exploited to a point where it cannot replenish itself will ultimately provide sub-optimal long-term economic returns for stakeholders. </p>\n<p>The status of a fish stock is evaluated through various processes of assessment that commonly combine biological and statistical information to assess changes in its abundance in response to fishing, which also enables forecasting of future trends. </p>\n<p>FAO has been periodically analysing and compiling the status of marine fish stocks combining the results of formal stock assessments available, including the assessments carried out at the regional level and a finer scale by national institutions and scientific working groups. For stocks that do not have a formal stock assessment, effort is made to collect relevant data and information from the literature, or from local experts, that could be used to infer stock status (for instance trends in catch rates, size frequency distribution of the catch, occasional fishing mortality estimates through surveys, etc.). The information from various sources is analysed and synthesized to classify the exploitation status of fish stocks. FAO monitoring of stocks will be enhanced with the implementation of SDG indicator 14.4.1, which tracks progress towards more fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at national, regional (across FAO Major Fishing Areas) and global levels.</p>\n<p>Based on FAO&#x2019;s monitoring of stocks at regional and global level, the percentage of fish resources that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a downward trend from 90 percent in 1974 to 67 percent in 2015, while 33 percent are considered to be overexploited. Overexploitation not only has negative ecological consequences, but also reduces long-term fishery yields, which have adverse social and economic effects, particularly for dependent communities in developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of GDP. However, the vast majority of countries report only aggregated data for value added for the fisheries and aquaculture sector. To overcome this problem it is necessary to separate the value added for marine capture fisheries from the aggregated data. Preferably this would be done using the value of marine capture fisheries as a proxy. However, in the absence of value data, the quantity of marine capture fisheries as a proportion of total production is used as a proxy for the proportion of value added.</p>\n<p>For marine capture fisheries, despite the expanded coverage of FAO&#x2019;s assessments in recent years, data deficiencies may lead to uncertainty as to the level of exploitation of a stock. While data limitations exist, the methodology employed by FAO seeks to eliminate discrepancies and provide a representative assessment of marine fish stocks. The time series for which stock assessment is available starts with the first public release of FAO stock assessment, in 2011 for each FAO Major Fishing area. FAO continues to release this information biennially.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p>National fish stock assessments are only available for a few countries, and therefore are not globally or regionally representative. Therefore, the sustainability multiplier used in the compilation of this indicator is based on the average fish stock sustainability calculated by FAO for each Major Fishing Area. For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the average sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine capture for each respective fishing area in which the country performs fishing activities. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">8</sup><p> The most recent version of Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources which contains stock status is available at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-9\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The method of computation for 14.7.1 differs depending on the availability of data.

information which is already provided by countries or published by FAO.

If a country has no marine capture fisheries then the indicator is not calculated for that country.</p>\n<p>No imputation is performed to derive estimates for countries or years when the value added of fisheries and aquaculture is not available. </p>\n<p>FAO employs a wide spectrum of data and analysis to assess 500 fish stocks, which accounts for 70&#x2013;80 percent of global landings.

Countries may fish in completely different fishing areas from others in their region, and therefore land-based regional aggregates can be inappropriate when dealing with marine resources.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>All data used in the calculation of this indicator is drawn from already available international sources. As such there is no additional reporting burden for countries.</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>In order to provide continuity of collection of data for value added for fisheries and aquaculture, and GDP across different versions of the Systems of National Accounts (SNA) and ISIC revisions, FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department ensures its consistency by the use of backwards and forwards linkages when collecting and validating the information.</p>\n<p>While SDG indicator 14.7.1 is completely constructed on data already provided by countries to FAO, to the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), countries are invited to collaborate with FAO to increase the precision of their results, by providing otherwise unavailable inputs for the calculation of the indicator.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator provides a clear framework for monitoring countries&#x2019; progress towards target 14.7. Inputs are robust, standardised, globally recognised and available for a wide range of countries, including many developing nations. As such there is comprehensive coverage for the majority of countries.</p>\n<p>There may be variation in the completeness of nationally reported data.

Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p>- Sustainable Development Goal 14.7.1: http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1471/en</p>\n<p>- FAO. 2018.
