IRENA collects this data from a wide range of publicly available sources, including the databases and annual reports of all of the main development finance institutions and 20 other bilateral and multilateral agencies investing in renewable energy. The database is updated annually and (at end-2016) covers public renewable energy investment flowing to 29 developed countries and 104 developing countries, for the period 2000-2015. As new publicly-funded financial institutions start investing in renewable energy, the IRENA database will expand to include these new investors over time.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>See above. </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Data for a year is collected during the following year.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>OECD DAC data is updated four time a year, with complete and detailed data published at year-end (covering the previous year).

Collecting official statistics (including international public finance flows) is in line with these aims. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Total ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify the public financial effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to developing countries for renewable energies. The additional flows (from the IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries and institutions not currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export credits. </p>\n<p>Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies to meet their future energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. This indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing countries to access these technologies.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered complete since 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. At present, flows to clean energy research and development are only partially covered by the database and a few other areas (e.g. off-grid electricity supply, investments in improved cookstove projects) may be covered only partially. </p>\n<p>The IRENA database currently only covers financial institutions that have invested a total of USD 400 million or more in renewable energy. The process of continuous improvement of the database includes verifying the data against data produced by the multilateral development banks for climate finance reporting and by comparing the data with other independent reporting by international development finance agencies.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The OECD flows are calculated by taking the total official flows (ODA and OOF) from DAC member countries, multilateral organisations and other providers of development assistance to the sectors listed above.
