As such, MMP and therefore the 10.7.3 dataset rely on other data providers &#x2013; including local authorities, NGOs, surveys with survivors and other sources &#x2013; which are outlined in <a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a>.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>International Organization for Migration (IOM)</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>IOM began documenting deaths during migration in 2014 under the Missing Migrants Project.

It is hoped that by counting and accounting for these deaths, almost all of which are linked to irregular migration, policymakers, academics, and the general public will be better informed about the risks linked to unsafe migration. While data by itself might not bring about change, it can provide the necessary evidence to prompt action. However, it is likely that the data currently available is a vast undercount of the true number of lives lost during migration. </p>\n<p>There are few official sources of data on deaths during migration, and as of 2021, none at a national level. Thus, MMP data are best understood as a minimum estimate of the true number of migrant deaths worldwide. Data are collected from a variety of sources outlined in <a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a>. In the disaggregated public database available from the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int\">MMP website</a>, there are several variables which indicate the information source and quality of each incident involving death(s) during migration. </p>\n<p>An important consideration in MMP data are that these information sources change over time. These changes are linked to the large geography covered by the relatively small and under-resourced MMP team, but also to narratives of migration &#x2018;crises&#x2019; that shape public attention and therefore data availability from media and non-governmental sources. This politicization of irregular migration &#x2013; notably the criminalization of search and rescue actors in the Mediterranean and United States-Mexico border &#x2013; profoundly affect access to relevant information and thus data coverage, quality and comparability. With this in mind, MMP data are best understood as indicative of the global nature of migrant fatalities and should not be used to identify trends over time.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on deaths during migration are fragmented, incomplete and scattered among many different sources. The MMP database provides a global overview of data on migrant fatalities, but it is primarily dependent on secondary sources of information. Information is gathered from diverse sources such as official records &#x2013; including from coast guards and medical examiners &#x2013; and other sources such as media reports, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and surveys and interviews of migrants. The reliability and completeness of data vary greatly from region to region, from country to country and over time. In addition to undercounting the absolute number of deaths which occur during migration, MMP data also lack identifying information in many cases (incl. age, gender, country of origin) which are vital to providing closure to families searching for loved ones lost during migration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a> illustrates the wide variety of sources used in the MMP database, and gives some insight into the various advantages and disadvantages of each. For example, some of the data are collected directly from migrants who have survived a deadly incident, typically via NGO/humanitarian actors or surveys of migrants. Eyewitness testimonies are often the only source of information about migrant deaths, especially those which occur on remote routes or in the many areas of the world where no official data on deaths during migration is collected. However, eyewitness testimonies are nearly impossible to verify on remote routes, and there is a small risk of double-counting if migrants report the same incident when asked whether they are aware of a death or disappearance. Data from surveys are similarly invaluable due to the dearth of data on this topic, but are not representative as they typically capture only a small fraction of the total number of people on the move who may have witnessed a death. . Similarly, media reports often provide information on migrant deaths that are not available from official sources, but may offer limited or even conflicting information, especially as the investigation and identification of bodies may occur after an initial report. As no State currently produces national-level data on deaths during migration (neither within their own territory nor of their nationals abroad) MMP data only represents documented, verified incidents and is best considered a very conservative estimate of the true number of lives lost during migration.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>MMP is an incident-based database, meaning that each entry in the database represents a single occurrence in which an individual or group of individuals die during migration or at international borders in one particular place and time.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> This approach is used instead of a body/human remains-based database due to the fact that many migrant bodies are never recovered, particularly in overseas routes such as the Mediterranean Sea, or remote terrains such as the Sahara Desert. MMP and therefore indicator 10.7.3 does not produce statistical estimates of the true number of lives lost given the extreme variance in completeness (coverage and quality) of data.</p>\n<p>The MMP database provides a global overview of data on migrant fatalities, but it is primarily dependent on secondary sources of information. Information is gathered from diverse sources such as official records &#x2013; including from coast guards and medical examiners &#x2013; and other sources such as media reports, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and surveys and interviews of migrants. When a record is added to the MMP database, often it is a result of bringing together several different data sources. For example, a death may be reported first by the media, and subsequently there may be a government statement confirming what happened, and then migrant families and community members may offer information on the likely identity of the person who died. The reliability and completeness of data vary greatly from region to region, from country to country and over time. <a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a> gives an overview of the data sources used and their various pros and cons.

In practice, this means that whenever possible each incident is based on multiple independent sources of information. Whenever possible, and especially for incidents reported in the media, MMP verifies each incident through consultation with local IOM staff and other relevant stakeholders. In mass casualty events where large numbers of people die and no remains are recovered (i.e. in shipwrecks) MMP data reflect the lowest estimated number of dead and missing persons. Several variables in the disaggregated dataset available from the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int\">MMP website</a> (Information source, Source Quality) reflect the level to which each incident could be validated.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>As the MMP database is incident-based and includes only verified deaths.

Generally, MMP&#x2019;s coverage is strongest in the Mediterranean and the US-Mexico border, whereas for the rest of the world data coverage is believed to be poor. However, coverage should not be equated with data quality, as for example in the case of the Mediterranean Sea, many remains are lost and consequently the data on the identities (age, gender, country of origin, name) of the decedents is highly incomplete.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>2014-present (ongoing data collection)</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Data on SDG 10.7.3 is aggregated by country and year per the SDG reporting standards.

While ideally all incidents recorded would include entries for each of these variables &#x2013; as these inform both the situation in which a death occurred and the profiles of those who died &#x2013; the lack of official data on deaths during migration, as described above, mean that this is not always possible. The minimum information necessary to record an incident in the MMP database is the date of the incident, the number of dead and/or the number of missing, and the location of death. If the information for other variables is unavailable, the cell is left blank or &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; is recorded, as indicated in the table below. </p>\n<h5>Table 2: Variables recorded in IOM&#x2019;s Missing Migrants Project database</h5>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Variable Name</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Description</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Incident</strong> ID</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>An automatically generated number used to identify each unique entry in the dataset.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Region of incident</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The region in which an incident took place.

At a minimum, the month and the year of death is recorded. In some cases, official statistics are not disaggregated by the incident, meaning that data is reported as a total number of deaths occurring during a certain time period. In such cases the entry is marked as a &#x201C;cumulative total,&#x201D; and the latest date of the range is recorded, with the full dates recorded in the comments.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Reported year</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The year in which the incident occurred.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Reported month</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The month in which the incident occurred.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number dead</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The total number of people confirmed dead in one<strong> </strong>incident, i.e. the number of bodies recovered.
