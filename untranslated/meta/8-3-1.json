In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate would provide a very incomplete picture of the labour market situation, overlooking major deficits in the quality of employment. Statistics on informality are key to assessing the quality of employment in an economy and are relevant to developing and developed countries alike (ILOSTAT indicator description for informality, available at <a href=\"https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-informality/\">https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-informality/</a>).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The considerable heterogeneity of definitions and operational criteria used by countries to measure informal employment greatly hinders the international comparability of statistics on informality. </p>\n<p>In order to counter this challenge, for the purpose of SDG global reporting and monitoring, the series is solely based on harmonized data produced by the ILO using the same operational process for all countries. Although some differences in criteria and definitions remain across countries, the process is designed to produce data that are as internationally comparable as possible given the underlying data sources. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi

Panel data regression and cross-validation techniques are used to establish the statistical relationships necessary for the imputation.

Where necessary and possible, the disaggregation by sector could go into a more detailed breakdown by economic activity. For the purpose of global and regional monitoring, no breakdowns of agriculture and non-agriculture are used.</p>\n<p>In order to produce this indicator, employment statistics disaggregated by formal/informal employment and by economic activity (agriculture/non-agriculture) are needed.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Although some international standards do exist for the compilation of informal employment statistics, the relevant concepts and definitions have been left relatively flexible so as to accommodate national contexts and needs. This means that, in practice, the operational criteria used by countries to compile data at the national level vary significantly from country to country, hindering the international comparability of statistics. The comparability of informal employment statistics is also highly sensitive to differences in the geographical areas covered, the economic activities covered and the treatment of special groups of workers.</p>\n<p>Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of standards (i.e., 13<sup>th</sup> or 19<sup>th</sup> ICLS) and contains only data comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue making meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users should not compare data across series. </p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li>ILO Guidebook - Decent Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guidebook on SDG Labour Market Indicators (https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/publications/WCMS_647109/lang--en/index.htm)</li>\n  <li>Resolution concerning statistics of employment in the informal sector, adopted by the Fifteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (January 1993), available at https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/normativeinstrument/wcms_087484.pdf</li>\n  <li>Guidelines concerning a statistical definition of informal employment, adopted by the Seventeenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (November-December 2003) available at https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/normativeinstrument/wcms_087622.pdf</li>\n  <li>ILO manual Measuring informality: A statistical manual on the informal sector and informal employment, available at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---</li>\n</ul>\n<p>publ/documents/publication/wcms_222979.pdf </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>ILOSTAT database, available at https://ilostat.ilo.org</li>\n  <li>Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013), available at <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm\">https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm</a></li>\n  <li>Resolution concerning statistics of the economically active population, employment, unemployment and underemployment, adopted by the 13<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 1982), available at <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/normativeinstrument/wcms_230304.pdf\">https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/normativeinstrument/wcms_230304.pdf</a>Quick guide to understanding the impact of the new statistical standards on ILOSTAT databases, available at https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_854830.pdf</li>\n  <li>International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/isic\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/isic</a> </li>\n</ul>","target_number":"8.3","goal_number":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-03-01"}
