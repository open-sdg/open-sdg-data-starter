Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation of forest area using remote sensing techniques has certain challenges. In particular the assessment of forest area relates to land use, while remote sensing primarily assesses land cover. Furthermore, gradual changes, such as forest regrowth, require several years to become detectable in satellite imagery. In addition, forest areas with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are still difficult to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing techniques.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>F</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mo>(</mo>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mo>)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>L</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mo>(</mo>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mo>)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>All data submitted by countries to FRA, including the FAO estimates made in case of desk studies, are available at the FRA online platform (<a href=\"https://fra-data.fao.org/\">https://fra-data.fao.org/</a>).
