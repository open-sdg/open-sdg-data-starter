This includes serious and minor bodily injuries and serious and minor physical force. According to the ICCS, these are defined as:</p>\n<p>Serious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife or stab wounds; severed limbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe or critical injuries.</p>\n<p>Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut; hit by an object; hit by a thrown object; poisoning and other applications of force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Minor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped teeth, swelling, black eye and other minor injuries.</p>\n<p>Minor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing, tripping, knocking down and other applications of force with the potential to cause minor bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Sexual violence (ICCS): Unwanted sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or contact or communication with unwanted sexual attention without valid consent or with consent as a result of intimidation, force, fraud, coercion, threat, deception, use of drugs or alcohol, or abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability. This includes rape and other forms of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Psychological violence: There is as yet no consensus at the international level of the precise definition of psychological violence and there is as yet no generally well-established methodology to measure psychological violence.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator is derived from surveys on crime victimization or from other household surveys with a module on crime victimization.</p>\n<p>The indicator refers to individual experience of the respondent, who is randomly selected among the household members, while experience of other members is not to be included.

It is globally relevant as violence in various forms occurs in all regions and countries of the world. Given that acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, this indicator needs to be based on data collected through sample surveys of the adult population.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Crime victimization surveys are able to capture experience of violence suffered by adult population of both sexes; however, due to the complexity of collecting information on experiences of violence, it is likely that not all experiences of violence are duly covered by these surveys, which aim to cover several types of crime experience. Other dedicated surveys on violence usually focus on selected population groups (typically women, children or the elderly) or in specific contexts (domestic violence, schools, prisons, etc.), but they are not able to portray levels and trends of violence in the entire population.</p>\n<p>While there are already international standards on measuring physical and sexual violence through survey instruments, there is currently no international standard on the measurement of psychological violence. One practical option could be to limit psychological violence to threatening behaviour, which does have an established methodology of measurement in victimization surveys. Threatening behaviour, at minimum, is an intentional behaviour that causes fear of injury or harm.</p>\n<p>Finally, indicators on prevalence of physical and sexual violence are usually produced and reported separately; the production of data on the prevalence of physical or sexual violence requires ad-hoc data collection.</p>\n<p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Number of survey respondents who have been victim of physical, psychological or sexual violence in the previous 12 months, divided by the total number of survey respondents.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Missing values are left blank</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>Missing values are left blank.
