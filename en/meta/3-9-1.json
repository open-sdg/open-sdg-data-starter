Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene.</p>\n<p>Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors (i.e., ambient and household air pollution) is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as the IER function integrates epidemiological evidence from four sources of PM (i.e., ambient air pollution, household air pollution, active smoking and second-hand smoking), some assumptions are assumed. Specifically, the relative risk at any concentration is independent of the source of PM2.5, and only dependent on the magnitude of the total exposure from all sources together (Burnett et al, 2020).</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g. the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).</p>\n<p>This allows calculation of the &apos;population attributable fraction&apos; (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).</p>\n<p>Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).</p>\n<p>To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).</p>\n<p>The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).</p>\n<p>The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>P</mi>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n    <mi>F</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>P</mi>\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mi>O</mi>\n    <mi>D</mi>\n    <mi>U</mi>\n    <mi>C</mi>\n    <mi>T</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>(</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>P</mi>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n    <mi>F</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mo>)</mo>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.</p>\n<p>The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).</p>\n<p>For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (Shaddick et al, 2018; Shaddick et al, 2021)), or for Indicator 11.6.2.</p>\n<p>For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]).
