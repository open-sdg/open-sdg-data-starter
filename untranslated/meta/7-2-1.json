The mission is realized through four workstreams: Data collection (since 1950); Development of methodological guidelines and standards in energy statistics (e.g., IRES, ESCM); Capacity building (to disseminate such methodology and to assist countries to strengthen their energy statistical systems); and International cooperation and coordination. UNSD was selected as one of the custodians of indicator 7.2.1 because it collects for all countries the underlying data necessary to calculate the indicator. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The target &#x201C;By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix&#x201D; impacts all three dimensions of sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical global problem of climate change. A number of definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in common is highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their consumption does not deplete their availability in the future. These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal sources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li>A limitation with existing renewable energy statistics is that they are not able to distinguish whether renewable energy is being sustainably produced. For example, a substantial share of today&#x2019;s renewable energy consumption comes from the use of wood and charcoal by households in the developing world, which sometimes may be associated with unsustainable forestry practices. There are efforts underway to improve the ability to measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a significant challenge. </li>\n  <li>Off-grid renewables data are limited and not sufficiently captured in national and international energy statistics. </li>\n  <li>The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same among all technologies. However, this is not always true; for example when renewables are usually located in more remote areas and may incur larger losses. </li>\n  <li>Likewise, imports and exports of electricity and heat are assumed to follow the renewable share of electricity and heat generation, respectively. This is a simplification that in many cases will not affect the indicator too much, but that might do so in some cases, for example, when a country only generates electricity from fossil fuels but imports a great share of the electricity it uses from a neighboring country&#x2019;s hydroelectric power plant. </li>\n  <li>Methodological challenges associated with defining and measuring renewable energy are more fully described in the Global Tracking Framework (IEA and World Bank, 2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, pages 194-200. Data for traditional use of solid biofuels are generally scarce globally, and developing capacity in tracking such energy use, including developing national-level surveys, is essential for sound global energy tracking.</li>\n</ul>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources &#x2013; statistics used to produce the energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described in the &#x201C;International Recommendations for Energy Statistics&#x201D; (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires\">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires</a>.</p>\n<p>Once an energy balance is developed, the indicator can be calculated by dividing final energy consumption from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption is derived as the sum of direct final consumption of renewable sources plus the components of electricity and heat consumption estimated to be derived from renewable sources based on generation shares. The indicator is calculated based on the following formula:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>F</mi>\n

Considerable effort has been made to ensure that the data adhere to the IEA definitions based on the guidelines provided by IRES. Nevertheless, energy statistics at the national level are often collected using criteria and definitions which differ, sometimes considerably, from those of international organisations. This is especially true for non-OECD countries, which are submitting data to the IEA on a voluntary basis. The IEA has identified most of these differences and, where possible, adjusted the data to meet international definitions. For details on recognized country specific anomalies and the corresponding adjustments, please refer to country specific notes included in the IEA World energy balances documentation file available at: <a href=\"http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf\">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf</a> </p>\n<p>Likewise, UNSD also needs to adjust certain data to fit the international methodology set by IRES, thus ensuring data comparability across countries. Data from all countries are submitted voluntarily to UNSD, sometimes via non-standard formats or through sharing of national publications. The identification of such deviations from the standard is an ongoing task, and UNSD has started publishing some of this information in a supplement to the Energy Statistics Database named &#x201C;Notes on sources&#x201D;, available at: unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/pubs/yearbook/, with the goal of increasing transparency and providing more and more information with time.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>The IEA has attempted to provide all the elements of energy balances down to the level of final consumption, for over 150 countries.
