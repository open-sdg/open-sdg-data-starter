In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by highlighting discrepancies between how much time women and men spend on unpaid work, like cooking, cleaning, or taking care of children.</p>\n<p>This indicator measures the average amount of time as a proportion in a day, so that if for a given country it is reported that women aged 15+ spend 10% of their day on unpaid domestic chores while men in the same age group spend 1%, it indicates that women spend 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes), while men spend 14.4 minutes on it a day, on average. As explained further in 4.c, this daily average is obtained from an average taken over the reference period for the data collection, and thus not mean that women and men spend these given amounts of time every single day. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Time use statistics have been used: (1) to provide a measure of the quality of life or general well-being of individuals and households; (2) to offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) to produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.</p>\n<p>International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by several factors, including: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or a stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of detail asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. </li>\n  <li>Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the The International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. </li>\n  <li>Time-use data presented refer to the &#x201C;main activity&#x201D; only. Any &#x201C;secondary activity&#x201D; performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect the international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. </li>\n  <li>Different target age populations used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.</li>\n</ol>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day.

obtain daily time spent.</p>\n<p>Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time-use statistics that are collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in each activity) only or (2) average time spent for all populations of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of average, the total time spent by the individuals who performed the activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. </p>\n<p><em>SDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measure can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. </em></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Most of the data are provided and validated by national statistical offices.

Furthermore, limited comparability across national data hampers the computation of regional aggregates. Nevertheless, UNSD regularly produces regional estimates to monitor and report on global trends. This is done by using the latest available data from each country in the region. In the case of insufficient data from a region, regional aggregates are not reported for the region. The SDG regions of &#x201C;Australia and New Zealand&#x201D; and &#x201C;Europe and North America&#x201D; are combined to produce a single aggregate for &#x201C;Developed region.&#x201D; In addition, the ratio of time spent by women and men are computed separately for each country and then averaged over the countries in the region to ensure comparability. </p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/23012019%20ICATUS.pdf</p>\n<p>Guide to Producing Statistics on Time-Use: Measuring Paid und Unpaid Work: <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_93E.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_93E.pdf</a></p>\n<p>System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008): <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp</a></p>\n<p>The Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm\">http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm</a></p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Details on quality management are available in the data quality for time use statistics paper, presented to the Statistical Commission in 2020:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3m-Defining_Quality-E.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3m-Defining_Quality-E.pdf</a></p>\n<p>This technical report was updated and further developed by the Expert Group on Innovative and Effective Ways to Collect Time-Use Statistics (EG-TUS)and was presented at the 53<sup>rd</sup> session of the Statistical Commission in March 2022.
