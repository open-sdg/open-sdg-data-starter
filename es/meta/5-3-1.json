The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices (NSOs), as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF will undertake an annual country consultation likely between December and January every year to allow for review and processing of the feedback received in order to meet global SDG reporting deadlines.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Annually in March.</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National Statistical Offices (in most cases)</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF)</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing of children. It provides technical and financial assistance to Member States to support their efforts to collect quality data on child marriage, including through the UNICEF-supported MICS household survey programme. UNICEF also compiles child marriage statistics with the goal of making internationally comparable datasets publicly available, and it analyses child marriage statistics which are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship publication, <em>The State of the World&#x2019;s Children.</em></p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl&#x2019;s development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. </p>\n<p>The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights &#x2013; such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. The modules used to collect information on marital status among women and men of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized.</p>\n<p>The measure of child marriage is retrospective in nature by design, capturing age at first marriage among a population that has completed the risk period (i.e., adult women). While it is also possible to measure the current marital status of girls under age 18, such measures would provide an underestimate of the level of child marriage, as girls who are not currently married may still do so before they turn 18.

The results of this country consultation are reviewed by UNICEF as the custodian agency.

These criteria include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level; data are collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates for the indicator.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation of the data before dissemination. </p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Comparable data on this indicator are currently available for 126 countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>At the country level, the latest available data for indicator 5.3.1 are published.
