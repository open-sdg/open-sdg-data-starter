The five principles are designed to provide a framework for data governance for the organization. The principles are intended primarily for use by all staff in order to help define the values and standards that govern how data that flows into, across and out of the organization is collected, processed, shared and used.

These include the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) statement. GATHER promotes best practices in reporting health estimates using a checklist of 18 items that should be reported every time new global health estimates are published, including descriptions of input data and estimation methods. Developed by a working group convened by the World Health Organization, the guidelines aim to define and promote good practice in reporting health estimates.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost 70 countries currently provide WHO with regular high-quality data on mortality by age, sex and causes of death, and another 58 countries submit data of lower quality.
