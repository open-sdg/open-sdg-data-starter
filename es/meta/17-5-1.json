Through this survey, UNCTAD seeks to collect data relevant to measure indicator 17.5.1 specifically, which refers to the efforts made by member States of the United Nations to promote outward investment to developing countries, including least developed countries (LDCs). </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 17.5 aims to adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for the least developed countries (LDCs). For the purpose of target 17.5, it is necessary to find out how many countries have put in place investment promotion regimes that may benefit LDCs directly. Therefore, SDG indicator 17.5.1, the number of countries that adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries, has been selected onto the indicator framework to assess the achievement of this target.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>SDG indicator 17.5.1 calls for the measurement of both adoption and implementation of investment promotion regimes. The adoption of investment promotion regimes for LDCs is an important yet not sufficient means for strengthening the global partnership for the SGDs (Goal 17). Subsequent implementation of these regimes is necessary for making the tool effective. However, getting comprehensive and reliable data on the implementation stage (i.e. how many investments in LDCs have actually been promoted through the promotion regime?) will be difficult. These data are usually not publicly available. However, to some extent, data may exist in aggregate form (see below). </p>\n<p>Furthermore, UNCTAD research indicated that many developed countries and some emerging economies have national investment promotion regimes in place that encourage investment abroad. Usually, however, these promotion regimes are available for outward investment in any country &#x2013; not only for investment in LDCs or other developing economies. Some types of investment policy tools can be more country-specific, like bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The indicator reporting started with preliminary estimates covering BITs, relying on comprehensive and country specific UNCTAD data on BITs. Over the past decade, broad consensus formed on the need to reform the BIT regime. UNCTAD provides detailed policy guidance to support the reform action of countries and regions. Data on the actual number of countries with an outward FDI promotion scheme that can benefit developing countries, including LDCs, constitutes a more accurate measurement for this indicator. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The proposed computation method includes the following in the compilation of SDG indicator 17.5.1: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong><em>Target countries of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The indicator methodology covers both: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Specific investment promotion regimes targeted for LDCs only; </li>\n  <li>Investment promotion regimes for developing countries in general, including LDCs. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The measurement should include outward investment promotion regimes that do not exclude developing countries. Only this approach ensures getting a full picture of outward investment promotion with LDCs as beneficiaries, which is better aligned with Target 17.5. By contrast, limiting the research to specific promotion regimes for LDCs only would result in partial information, because the number of LDCs that receive support through investment promotion regimes for all developing countries is likely to be much higher than the number of LDCs that benefit from LDC-specific promotion regimes. Therefore, both types are included when identifying the countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong><em>Types of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on consultations and feasibility studies on <em>what types</em> of investment promotion regimes to look at, the following methodology is suggested: </p>\n<p>Countries use various means to promote foreign investment abroad (see above &#x201C;Concepts&#x201D;). Indicator 17.5.1 will focus on the legal investment instruments, since relevant information is &#x2013; to various degrees - usually publicly available, and thus feasible to compile. </p>\n<p>Information is less frequently available on informal and ad-hoc means of outward investment promotion, such as advisory services. The availability of reliable information on such measures would vary greatly across countries. Thus, including such information would hamper the international comparability of the indicator.</p>\n<p>To be included in the number of countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion regimes, the existence of at least one type of promotion instrument (e.g. an investment guarantee scheme or financial support for outward investment that can benefit developing countries, including LDCs) would be sufficient.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong><em>Adoption vs. implementation of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Consultations and feasibility studies were carried out on whether &#x2013; in addition to the existence of an outward investment promotion regime, i.e., whether such tools were signed or otherwise adopted &#x2013; it would also be feasible to examine as to what extent the regime was actually <em>implemented,</em> i.e., whether the regime is in force or even if an LDC <em>actually benefitted</em> from it, e.g., by receiving a foreign investment promoted by an investment guarantee. It was concluded to focus the research on the <em>adoption</em> of a promotion system as such Otherwise information on the actual stage of implementation in individual countries is usually not publicly available; scattered data about the situation in some countries could not provide a comprehensive and reliable picture of the overall situation. However, it may be possible to come up with some aggregate data at the regional or global level (see below).</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong><em>Coverage of home countries of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is also a question of <em>which countries</em> should be included in the measure as home countries of outward investment promotion regimes.
