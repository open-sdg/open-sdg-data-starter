No poverty</p>\n<p>The capacity for physical work is hampered when people are anaemic. Anaemia is estimated to contribute to 17% lower productivity in heavy manual labour and 5% lower productivity in other manual labour. A modelling exercise in India estimated that a birth cohort of individuals with iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) in 2013 will lose more than US$ 24 million over their lifetimes as a result of productivity loss due to IDA.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the mental capacity that is undeveloped when children are iron deficient affects their academic performance and future earnings potential. Consequently, childhood anaemia is associated with a 2.5% drop in wages in adulthood, affecting both productivity and economic growth.</p>\n<p>Nutrient deficiencies that can contribute to anaemia include iron, riboflavin, folic acid, zinc, vitamin B12, and vitamin A. Currently, more than 80 countries have legislation to add one or more of these nutrients to wheat flour, maize flour, and/or rice. Adding these nutrients to commonly consumed grains is one step toward improving productivity and thereby reducing poverty.</p>\n<p>Goal 3. Good health and well-being</p>\n<p>Maternal and Newborn Health</p>\n<p>Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. Anaemia during pregnancy also contributes to low birth-weight infants, which the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as weighing less than less than 2500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Newborns that are born small are prone to death and diseases while they are young. If they survive, they are at an increased risk for poor mental development in childhood and chronic health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.</p>\n<p>Non-Communicable Diseases</p>\n<p>Anaemia is a non-communicable disease. As noted above, nutritional anaemia is caused by vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p>\n<p>Goal 4. Quality education</p>\n<p>Poor health in childhood can lead to reductions in educational achievement. While iron deficiency limits cognitive development, children who have adequate iron have more energy to participate in classroom exercises, and they are more mentally prepared to master the material.</p>\n<p>A large body of literature documents the positive impact of iron interventions on tests of cognitive and motor development. This review found, &#x201C;the available evidence satisfies all of the conditions needed to conclude that iron deficiency causes cognitive deficits and developmental delays and that these can be at least partially reversed by iron therapy, though the effect may diminish among older children.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Goal 5. Gender equality</p>\n<p>Anaemia rates in females are much higher than males. While anaemia rates decrease for males by the end of puberty, they remain high for females through reproductive years due to menstruation.</p>\n<p>Therefore, reducing anaemia contributes to boosting females&#x2019; relative academic performance and worker productivity and helps achieve gender equality.</p>\n<p>For more details, see Food Fortification Initiative - Fortify to Address Sustainable Development Goals (http://www.ffinetwork.org/why_fortify/SDGs.html).</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"<p>World Health Organization (WHO)</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"<p>World Health Organization (WHO)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>Percentage of women aged 15&#x2212;49 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>Anaemia: condition in which the concentration of blood haemoglobin concentration falls below established cut-off values.</p>\n<p>Iron deficiency : state in which there is insufficient iron to maintain the normal physiological function of blood, brain and muscles (ICD-11, 5B5K.0 iron deficiency)</p>\n<p>Iron deficiency anaemia: (ICD-11, 3A00, iron deficiency anaemia)</p>\n<p>Blood haemoglobin concentration: concentration of haemoglobin in whole blood</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p> Percentage</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>WHO.

It negatively affects cognitive and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when used in combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to &#x201C;shrink&#x201D; towards global means when data are sparse. </p>\n<p>Estimates may differ from those reported by countries.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. Data collected from 1995 to 2020 were used. Adjustment of data on blood haemoglobin concentrations for altitude and smoking was carried out whenever possible. Biologically implausible haemoglobin values (&lt;25 g/L or &gt;200 g/L) were excluded. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically addressed missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

Briefly, the model calculates estimates for each country and year, informed by data from that country and year themselves, if available, and by data from other years in the same country and in other countries with data for similar time periods, especially countries in the same region. The model borrows data, to a greater extent, when data are non-existent or weakly informative, and to a lesser degree for data-rich countries and regions. The resulting estimates are also informed by covariates that help predict blood haemoglobin concentrations (e.g. socio-demographic index, meat supply (kcal/capita), mean BMI for women and log of under-five mortality for children). The uncertainty ranges (credibility intervals) reflect the major sources of uncertainty, including sampling error, non-sampling error due to issues in sample design/measurement, and uncertainty from making estimates for countries and years without data.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Once survey data are compiled and the Bayesian hierarchical mixture model is run to generate anaemia estimates, countries are sent a memorandum to provide a background to the estimates and explain the process.
