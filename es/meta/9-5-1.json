In agreement with these three organisations, their data (which were collected from their member states/associated member states &#x2013; around 65 countries-) are directly obtained from the respective databases (in the case of the OECD and Eurostat) or received from the partner (in the case of RICYT). There is also collaboration in Africa with the African STI Indicators Initiative (ASTII) of AU/NEPAD. </p>\n<p>For the data UIS sends a questionnaire to, the process is the following:</p>\n<p>i. A questionnaire is sent to focal points in countries, generally within the Ministry of Science and Technology or the national statistical office.</p>\n<p>ii.

During the data processing stage, for each questionnaire received from countries where UIS sends questionnaires to, the above quality aspects are looked into and a data report is produced identifying problematic issues/inconsistent data for each respective country. The UIS sends such data reports, including the calculated indicators for target 9.5, providing the countries with the opportunity to review the data/indicators and submit any clarifications or modifications/additions before releasing data at the UIS Data Centre and submitting the data to UNSD for inclusion in the global SDG Indicators Database.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The data should comply with the concepts/definitions and guidelines provided in the international standards (i.e. the OECD Frascati Manual) and should cover all sectors of performance, representing all institutions, which are engaged in R&amp;D activities in the country.
