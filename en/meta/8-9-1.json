The value of the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, could indicate the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. </p>\n<p>This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at national level and the level of sub-national regions as it gives a more inclusive measure of the economic contribution of tourism (i.e. including all forms of tourism according to International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008), which can be compared to GDP contributions of other economic activities. The indicator has been found especially useful in promoting and mainstreaming tourism in policy agendas at all levels. The indicator can also be compared across countries. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Given that a growing number of countries produce Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), data on the suggested indicators could become available in many more countries in the near future. </p>\n<p>The data demands &#x2013; among others - detailed input-output or supply and use tables for setting up a TSA; this means that it is often not possible to have current data or frequent updating of the TSA. Therefore, some countries produce estimates of TSA aggregates, in between reference years, to have more current data and to produce a time series. </p>\n<p>TDGDP/GDP tends to do not show large variations from one year to the next and variations may stem from the numerator and/or denominator.

For reference years between years with reported data, a linear trend between reported years is used. </li>\n  <li><em>Special cases<br></em>Some data reported by countries that do not correspond to Tourism Direct GDP or GVA and are therefore not published, can still be used in the calculation of aggregates. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each year, countries without reported data for which the methodology yields negative estimates or for which no data to feed the linear models are available are discarded. Regional (and global) aggregates are then obtained by computing weighted averages of TDGDP, using total GDP as the weight, for countries within the region of interest for which data or estimates are available. </p>\n<p>GDP coverage for each aggregate is obtained by calculating the percentage of total regional GDP that is represented by countries for which data is reported or for which an estimate is available. If this coverage is relatively low (below 60 percent), estimates are published with a cautionary footnote. </p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>The methodology is described in the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradeserv/tourism/manual.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008</u></a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>UNWTO, in collaboration with UNSD, is currently developing a Compilation Guide for the TSA. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the purposes of SDG reporting, UNWTO has developed an experimental approach that might be used by countries with limited data to compile estimates of TDGDP using the conceptual framing of the TSA and the most commonly available data but not requiring the full compilation of TSA.
