It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners. </p>\n<p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey.

In addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. </p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting developing countries in collecting relevant data through the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level. </p>\n<p>Complementarily, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has been conducting a regular survey for the Development Cooperation Forum, in cooperation with UNDP, to identify national progress in mutual accountability and transparency. Survey results are assessed in comprehensive studies, informing global monitoring and providing practical suggestions for improving development results. Synergies with the measurement of indicator 7 of the Global Partnership monitoring framework are being used. Other complementary sources of data (i.e. additional multi-stakeholder frameworks) may be incorporated in the future to provide a broader picture of progress made by countries towards development effectiveness in support of SDG implementation. </p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&apos;s monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </p>\n<p>(ii) The national coordinator in turn consults with other stakeholders (including country offices of providers of development co-operation, Civil Society Organisations, the private sector, and trade unions) to gather and validate data.</p>\n<p>The data is then reviewed by headquarters/offices of providers of development co-operation.</p>\n<p>(iii) No adjustments are made to submitted data, given that the validation process needs to stay at country level. However, inconsistencies or possible problematic values are highlighted and sent back to national coordinators for revision.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>The data collection calendar for global data aggregation was on a biennial cycle prior to 2020.

These representatives coordinate the data collection process at the national level by consolidating data and inputs from providers of development co-operation, Civil Society Organisations, the private sector, and trade unions. For calculation of indicator 17.16.1, country governments submit the data to the OECD/UNDP Joint Support Team of the Global Partnership.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly compile and report the data at the global level.</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>As custodians of this SDG indicator, OECD and UNDP are responsible for providing technical guidance and supporting countries to collect data, compiling and verifying country data, and for submitting the country data and aggregate data for this indicator. Drawing on their institutional support provided to the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, OECD and UNDP leverage country participation in the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, which since 2013 has tracked progress towards the effectiveness principles and is the recognised source of data and evidence on upholding effectiveness commitments, to aggregate global data for this indicator. Countries not participating in the Global Partnership monitoring exercise are able to submit their country data directly to OECD and UNDP. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires mobilizing and strengthening multi stakeholder partnerships that can bring and effectively use all the available knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources for sustainable development. The quality of the relationship between all the relevant partners defines the strength of the global partnership for sustainable development.</p>\n<p>The indicator provides a measure of countries&#x2019; efforts to enhance these multi stakeholder partnerships, and by extension the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, by looking at progress made on a set of indicators that track how well country governments and development partners are working together towards sustainable development. </p>\n<p>Reflecting the spirit of the global partnership for sustainable development, and the universal nature of the SDGs, the indicator monitors the contribution and behaviour of both provider and recipient countries in establishing more effective, inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships to support and sustain the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It does so by measuring their respective but differentiated commitments to strengthen the quality of their development partnerships.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The design of the indicator has practical benefits: </p>\n<p>&#x2022; the indicator allows for relevant monitoring frameworks to be updated in line with evolving commitments and country specific context without affecting the spirit of the indicator;</p>\n<p>&#x2022; the indicator does not presume a globally-set multi-stakeholder framework, acknowledging the diversity of complementary efforts supporting effective development cooperation;</p>\n<p>&#x2022; the indicator allows participating countries to choose whether they would like to report as a provider of development co-operation, as a recipient, or both. </p>\n<p>Data collection for the Global Partnership monitoring framework is led by countries receiving development co-operation. Progress of countries providing development co-operation in implementing development effectiveness commitments is captured through their partnership behaviour in those countries. Depending on each case, countries that currently are both recipient and providers of development cooperation opt to report in their role as recipient and/or provider of development cooperation.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>To reflect the universal nature of target 17.16, this indicator is presented as the global aggregate number of countries reporting progress.
