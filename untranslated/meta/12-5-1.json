However, currently the total amount of produced materials that are recycled are estimated to be low (based on academic literature). If countries are to better understand how waste are generated, collected and recycled then this will put countries and other stakeholders in a better position to identify how to tackle the issues face for key waste streams (such as metals, e-waste or plastics). </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Most countries control large end-of-chain recycling facilities and export of recyclable materials, so data from these entities is feasible to collect. There may be recycling carried out in the informal sector that never enters the formal channels, in this case countries can estimate the size of the informal recycling sector to properly account for all the recycling in the country. </p>\n<p>National recycling rate is part of measuring progress towards sustainable consumption and production, but it does not capture prevention, reduction, reuse and repair. Calculating additional intensity indicators against the DMC and the material flow (MF) gives proxies and helps connect this indicator to resource efficiency in consumption and production.</p>\n<p>Additional research is needed to understand typical losses (due to transformation of materials, loss of humidity, % of rejects) along the recycling chain for various recyclable materials. The losses would need to be known as %-ages from the point of entry in the recycling value chain (I.e. Collection of source segregated material, or input to sorting facility) to the point of exit (I.e. when the material leaves the last recyclable processing unit to enter a facility as secondary raw material). This would allow to connect indicator 11.6.1. which will measure among other things the municipal recycling rate, to the national recycling rate. Municipal recycling rate is likely going to be measured at the beginning of the chain, while indicator 12.5.1 will likely be measured at the point of exit from the chain. Such studies may be done using the process flow and material mass balance approach. Another approach could be to follow transactions in the waste management process and introducing so called &#x201C;system of boundaries&#x201D; defining points of reporting of waste quantities. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, &#x201C;Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document (UNEP, forthcoming)&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>For the purposes of this indicator, the National Recycling Rate will be defined as the quantity of material recycled in the country plus quantities exported for recycling out of total waste generated in the country, minus material imported intended for recycling.

e-waste and other waste types (such as packaging waste and metals). For the disaggregation by waste stream the formula will be the same, but particular waste types will be evaluated. (Existing data on e-waste and the importance of e-waste means that this disaggregation will be collected at the global level.)</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>UNSD carries out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data.
