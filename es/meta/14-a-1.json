The purpose of the Commission is to promote international cooperation and to coordinate programmes in research, services and capacity-development, in order to learn more about the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas and to apply that knowledge for the improvement of management, sustainable development, the protection of the marine environment, and the decision-making processes of its Member States. In addition, IOC is recognized through the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as a competent international organization in the fields of Marine Scientific Research (Part XIII) and Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV). According to its Statutes, the Commission may act also as a joint specialized mechanism of the organizations of the United Nations system that have agreed to use the Commission for discharging certain of their responsibilities in the fields of marine sciences and ocean services, and have agreed accordingly to sustain the work of the Commission. IOC&#x2019;s Member States agreed to submit information relevant to the SDG indicator 14.a.1 to the IOC Secretariat in 2014 IOC/EC-XLVII/2 Annex 8. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Sustained investment in research and development (R&amp;D), including ocean research, remains essential to advance knowledge and to develop new technology needed to support modern economies. The ocean economy yields various benefits in terms of employment, revenues and innovation in many domains. Its current developments are largely based on decades of science and R&amp;D investments by governments around the world. Baseline information on ocean science funding, as delivered by the indicator 14.a.1 can be used as a starting point for more directed, tailored investment and new capacity development strategies, and to support the case for ensuring maximum impact of ocean research, for example through marine technology and knowledge transfer from government-funded marine and maritime R&amp;D projects. Annual (2009-2013) baseline information for 24 countries is presented in the GOSR (Isensee, K., Horn, L. and Schaaper, M. 2017. The funding for ocean science.

The GOSR reports ocean science investment and the resulting capacity in a transparent and inclusive manner, based on a unique collection of primary data, is an opportunity to support and measure progress in capacity development globally. This ambition of the 2030 Agenda is also evident in the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021&#x2013;2030, hereafter &#x2018;the Ocean Decade&#x2019;), where the definition of &#x2018;ocean science&#x2019; encompasses natural and social science disciplines, including interdisciplinary approaches; the technology and infrastructure that supports ocean science; the application of ocean science for societal benefits, including knowledge transfer and applications in regions that are currently lacking science capacity; as well as science-policy and science-innovation interfaces. Data and information presented in the GOSR2020, in future editions of the report and in the new GOSR portal will form part of the monitoring and evaluation process to track the progress of the Ocean Decade in achieving its vision &#x2018;The science we need for the ocean we want&#x2019;, via the objectives, challenges and seven goals outlined in the Ocean Decade Implementation Plan.
