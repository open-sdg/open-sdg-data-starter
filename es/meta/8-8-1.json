Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Occupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. An occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-fatal injuries could entail the loss of workdays). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Case of occupational injury: the case of one worker incurring one or more occupational injuries as a result of one occupational accident. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Workers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the average number of workers in the particular group under consideration and who are covered by the source of the statistics on occupational injuries (for example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity, occupation, region, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered by a particular insurance scheme, accident notification systems, or household or establishment survey). </p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Ratio of cases per 100,000 workers</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Migrant status is determined according to country of birth (native-born or foreign-born) or country of citizenship (citizen or non-citizen). </p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The recommended data sources are different types of administrative records, such as records of national systems for the notification of occupational injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; insurance and compensation records, death registers), supplemented by household surveys (especially in order to cover informal sector enterprises and the self-employed) and/or establishment surveys. </p>\n<p>The metadata should clearly specify (i) whether the statistics relate to cases of occupational injury which have been reported (to an accident notification system or to an accident compensation scheme), compensated (by an accident insurance scheme) or identified in some other way (for example through a survey of households or establishments) and (ii) whether cases of occupational disease and cases of injury due to commuting accidents are excluded from the statistics, as recommended. </p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey microdata sets in line with internationally-agreed indicator concepts and definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators. </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Continuous</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Continuous</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>Labour ministries, labour inspection, national insurance, and/or national statistical offices </p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>International Labour Organisation (ILO) </p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal of disseminating internationally-comparable datasets, and provides technical assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to produce high quality labour market data. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator provides valuable information that could be used to formulate policies and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries, diseases and deaths. It could also be used to monitor the implementation of these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular occupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide information for prevention purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations and economic activities with the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety and reveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers&#x2019; organizations, workers and workers&#x2019; organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers, employers&#x2019; organizations, workers and workers&#x2019; organizations to introduce accident prevention measures. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>There may be problems of underreporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality. Underreporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. Double-counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be calculated separately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a different source than those on non-fatal injuries, which would make their sum into total occupational accidents inaccurate.</p>\n<p>The fatal occupational injury incidence rate is expressed per 100,000 workers in the reference group, and thus, is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi

Data derived from administrative records are not strictly comparable since they include numerous types of records that follow different rules and are maintained by different agencies. Two main sources of data are records of notifications by employers to the competent authority and insurance records of the authority compensating the victims. These two would clearly yield different results, since it is possible that not all injuries that were compensated to workers were reported by the employer and vice versa. It is also possible that these records have a different geographical coverage or that they cover different economic activities.</p>\n<p>When statistics come from an establishment survey, the results would be closer to those from records of notifications made by employers since it is also the employer who provides the establishment survey information. However, establishment surveys tend not to cover the informal sector, establishments of a very small size and sometimes the agricultural sector. </p>\n<p>When statistics come from a household survey, their reliability depends heavily on the accuracy of the respondents, who may be subjective in the information given.</p>\n<p> </p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>ILO Guidebook - Decent Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guidebook on SDG Labour Market Indicators (<a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/publications/WCMS_647109/lang--en/index.htm\">https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/publications/WCMS_647109/lang--en/index.htm</a>) </li>\n  <li>ILOSTAT database: <a href=\"https://ilostat.ilo.org\">https://ilostat.ilo.org</a> </li>\n  <li>ILOSTAT Metadata &#x2013; Indicator Descriptions (<a href=\"https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-occupational-injuries/\">https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-occupational-injuries/</a>) </li>\n  <li>Decent Work Indicators Manual: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/integration/resources/pubs/WCMS_229374/lang--en/index.htm\">https://www.ilo.org/integration/resources/pubs/WCMS_229374/lang--en/index.htm</a> </li>\n  <li> Resolution concerning statistics of occupational injuries (resulting from occupational accidents) adopted by the 16th ICLS in 1998: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_087528/lang--en/index.htm\">https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_087528/lang--en/index.htm</a> </li>\n</ul>","indicator":"8.8.1","target_id":"8.8","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-08-01"}
