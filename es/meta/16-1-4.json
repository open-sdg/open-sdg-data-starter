It affects the way in which human beings interact with their surroundings, their health, and consequently, their quality of life. Indicator 16.1.4 taps into the concept of &#x2018;fear of crime&#x2019;, which has been elicited in dozens of crime victimization surveys, and the standard formulation used here has been shown to be applicable in different cultural contexts.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup> It is important to note that fear of crime is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that fear of crime may be even largely independent from actual experience. The perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is influenced by several factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion, the media discourse, and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, fear of crime is an important indicator in itself as high levels of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and engagement in the community, and thus represent an obstacle to development. Fear of crime also differs across demographic groups and this indicator helps to identify vulnerable groups.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 56. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>\n<p>There are several limitations associated with the wording of the survey question used to measure fear of crime (&#x2018;How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood after dark?&#x2019;). First, the question assumes that respondents do the following: (1) go out, (2) go out alone, (3) go out in their neighbourhood, and (4) go out after dark. For many respondents, the reasons for not going out alone in their neighbourhood after dark may have nothing or little to do with crime and more to do with personal and circumstantial issues, such as lack of mobility, childcare commitments, or the use of a car that allows them to travel further afield. Second, the question does not define the meaning of &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D;, which may mean different things to different respondents, even those living in the same street. Third, the question does not explicitly refer to &#x2018;crime&#x2019;, but rather it is implicit in the question. There may be other reasons unrelated to crime (e.g. wild animals, traffic, etc.) why respondents may not feel safe walking around their neighbourhood after dark.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">6</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 57. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The question used in victimization surveys is: How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood after dark?<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup> Answer options are typically: (1) Very safe, (2) safe, (3) unsafe (4), very unsafe, (5) I never go out alone at night/does not apply, (99) don&#x2019;t know.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup> The proportion of population that feel safe is calculated by summing up the number of respondents who feel &#x201C;very safe&#x201D; and &#x201C;safe&#x201D; and dividing the total by the total number of respondents, and multiplying by 100.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mn>16</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>4</mn>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>N</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>w</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>w</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>X</mi>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> This question is intended to capture respondents&#x2019; perception of safety when thinking about crime, although it does not explicitly mention crime or prime respondents to think about crime.
