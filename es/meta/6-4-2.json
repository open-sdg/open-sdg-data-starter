A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. </p>\n<p>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources.

It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, services (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries (including cooling of thermoelectric plants). Freshwater withdrawal includes fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. </p>\n<p>Environmental flow requirements (EFR) are defined as the quantity and timing of freshwater flows and levels necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems, which, in turn, support human cultures, economies, sustainable livelihoods, and wellbeing. Water quality and also the resulting ecosystem services are excluded from this formulation which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and the support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not important and should not be taken care of.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> Methods of computation of EFR are extremely variable and range from global estimates to comprehensive assessments for river reaches.

(FAO Constitution, Article 1)</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country&apos;s water demand. It measures a country&apos;s pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress regarding &#x201C;withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity&#x201D;, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.</p>\n<p>The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.</p>\n<p>However, extremely low values may indicate the inability of a country to use properly its water resources for the benefit of the population. In such cases, a moderate and controlled increase in the value of the indicator can be a sign of positive development.</p>\n<p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country&#x2019;s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.</p>\n<p>The indicator is computed based on three components:</p>\n<p><strong>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Environmental flow requirements (EFR)</strong></p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of renewable freshwater resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. </p>\n<p>Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, especially in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator. Although there is no universal consensus on such thresholds, a proposal is presented below.</p>\n<p>Trends in freshwater withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other. </p>\n<p>Estimation of water withdrawal by sector may represent a limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries publish water withdrawal data on a regular basis by sector. </p>\n<p>There is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country&apos;s borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress. </p>\n<p>Other limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; </li>\n  <li>potentially large variation of sub-national data; </li>\n  <li>lack of account of historical (e.g., due to climate change and population growth) and seasonal variations in water resources;</li>\n  <li>lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; </li>\n  <li>lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and</li>\n  <li>the indicator can be higher than 100 percent when water withdrawal non-renewable freshwater (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when freshwater withdrawal includes part or all the water set aside for environmental flow requirements. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the indicator at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>\n<p>Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TFWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental flow requirements (EFR), multiplied by 100.
