The operationalization of these concepts is to be provided by national implementation teams by adding appropriate response categories for the authorities and mechanisms to which victims may report the violence they have experienced. </p>\n<p><strong>Physical violence:</strong> This concept corresponds to physical assault and robbery.</p>\n<p>Assault is defined in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) as: the intentional or reckless application of physical force inflicted upon the body of a person. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> This includes the intentional or reckless application of serious physical force resulting in serious bodily injury, and the intentional or reckless application of minor physical force resulting in no injury or minor bodily injury. According to the ICCS, these are defined as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Serious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife or stab wounds; severed limbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe or critical injuries.</li>\n  <li>Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut; hit by an object; hit by a thrown object; poisoning and other applications of force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury.</li>\n  <li>Minor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped teeth, swelling, black eye and other minor injuries.</li>\n  <li>Minor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing, tripping, knocking down and other applications of force with the potential to cause minor bodily injury.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to acts of assault, acts amounting to serious physical threats are also included in the definition of physical violence. As defined in the ICCS, serious physical threats refer to threats with the intention to cause death or serious bodily injury.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, physical violence also covers acts of robbery, defined in the ICCS as unlawfully taking or obtaining property with the use of force or threat of force against a person with intent to permanently or temporarily withhold it from a person or organization.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Physical violence only counts as such when it is non-consensual, for example, acts of physical violence (punching, kicking, etc.) experienced while exercising a regulated combat sport or combat training will not count towards victimization prevalence.</p>\n<p>In the absence of suitable data on physical violence, it is possible to use data on physical assault or robbery , given they are both component of physical violence. </p>\n<p><strong>Psychological violence:</strong> There is no consensus at the international level on the precise definition of psychological violence. Psychological violence may be defined as any intentional and reckless act that causes psychological distress to an individual. Psychological violence can take the form of, for example, coercion, defamation, humiliation, intimidation, credible threats of violence, excessive verbal attacks or bullying, or harassment. Often, psychological violence is a pattern of behaviours, but it may be a distinct incident as well. Psychological violence is often experienced in domestic contexts. The internationally standardized and tested SDG 16 survey questionnaire provides a methodology and a core set of questions to measure psychological violence (see Section 4.c. Method of computation). </p>\n<p><strong>Sexual violence</strong>: As defined in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), sexual violence includes unwanted sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act without valid consent or with consent as a result of intimidation, force, fraud, coercion, threat, deception, use of drugs or alcohol, or abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability. This includes rape and other forms of sexual assault, excluding non-physical sexual assault (e.g. sexual harassment). Sexual violence may be perpetrated by casual partners, by acquaintances or by strangers, but such acts also occur in established or even in formalized intimate partnerships, including in marriages. Sexual violence most often, but not exclusively, targets women. Sexual violence may also take place in same-sex contexts.</p>\n<p>More details on the set of behaviours to be used to measure physical, psychological and sexual violence are provided in Section 4.c.

The sampling frame and sample design should ensure that results can be disaggregated at sub-national level. The sample size should be sufficiently large to capture relevant events and compute needed disaggregations.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>At the international level, data on reporting of physical, psychological and sexual violence are routinely collected by UNODC through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. As requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 140 Member States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that delivers UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once consolidated, data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and validity.</p>\n<p>The UN-CTS provides specific definitions of data to be collected in line with the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS). It also collects a set of metadata to identify possible discrepancies from standard definitions and to assess overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.).</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys on crime victimisation in regular intervals, but at least every four years to reflect progress between each of the quadrennial reviews of Goal 16 at the High Level Political Forum (HLPF).</p>\n<p>UNODC collects data on this indicator according to the following schedule:</p>\n<p>III-IV quarter year n</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on relevant SDG indicators are collected, compiled and sent back to countries for data review annually.

It does so through several Global programmes and through the UNODC field office network.</p>\n<p>UNODC is responsible for carrying out the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), which was introduced through the General Assembly Resolution <a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)\">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972. The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984, further requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for crime victims to seek justice: If competent authorities are not alerted, they are not in a position to conduct proper investigations and administer justice. However, lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing the authorities, can negatively influence the reporting behaviour of crime victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance and bring perpetrators to justice. Reporting rates also provide a measure of the &#x201C;hidden figure&#x201D; of crime, that is, the proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can be used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not perceptions.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Crime victimization surveys are able to capture experience and reporting of violence suffered by adult population of both sexes; however, due to the complexity of collecting information on experiences of violence, it is likely that not all experiences and reporting of violence are duly covered by these surveys, which aim to cover several types of crime experience. Other dedicated surveys on violence usually focus on selected population groups (typically women, children or the elderly) or specific contexts (domestic violence, schools, prisons, etc.), but they are not able to portray levels and trends of violence in the entire population.</p>\n<p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age and older), while sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>\n<p>Questions on violence reporting require national adaptations of the formal authorities that in the national context are eligible and normally function as law enforcement agents (various branches of police, specialized branches of military responsible for law enforcement, or religious police) or other nationally relevant mechanisms, including informal authorities that are widely used to obtain redress for victims of violence. NSOs are advised to keep the police and medical services in first two positions and should be included by default. Among informal competent authorities, NSOs may consider mechanisms in public and private institutions for addressing the experience of violence (e.g. offices of internal affairs or internal disciplinary control) or traditional leadership structures such as tribal or religious leaders or community elders.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is calculated as the number of survey respondents who were victims of (a) physical, (b) psychological, and(c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months and who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, divided by the total number of survey respondents who were victims of (a) physical, (b) psychological, and(c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months (also called the &#x2018;crime reporting rate&#x2019;).</p>\n<p>Three separate indicators should be computed, one for each type of violence.</p>\n<p>The indicators refer to the individual (&#x201C;direct&#x201D;) experience and reporting of the respondent, who should be randomly selected among eligible household members. Experiences and reporting of violence by other members of the household should not to be included in the computation.</p>\n<p>The internationally standardized and tested <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/sdgs/SDG16_Survey_Initiative_-_Questionnaire.pdf\">SDG 16 Survey questionnaire</a> and the accompanying <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/sdgs/SDG16_Survey_Initiative_-_Implementation_Manual.pdf\">Implementation Manual</a>, which can be used by countries for collecting data SDG indicator 16.3.1, provide a core set of questions about specific behaviours that allow for the measurement of the reporting rate of physical, sexual and psychological violence in the population. The Latin America and the Caribbean Crime Victimization Survey Initiative (LACSI) also offers a standardised methodology to measure violence reporting. While the precise formulation and wording of the pertinent survey questions may need national customization, a core set of behaviours have been identified as indicative of physical, psychological and sexual violence exercised towards a person.</p>\n<p>Questions on physical, psychological and sexual violence are to be measured separately.

LACSI goes beyond measuring SDG 2030 survey-based indicators and promotes the measurement of a wide range of dimensions to be measured in terms of safety and victimization that can be of use for policy makers and countries to better understand crime<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator has recently been included into the annual United Nations Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS, the regular data collection used by UNODC to collect data from UN Member States. It is expected that countries will gradually report on this indicator as the methodological guidance is disseminated and relevant items are included in national surveys.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Recommended disaggregations for this indicator are:</p>\n<p>- sex</p>\n<p>- age</p>\n<p>- type of violence (physical, psychological, sexual)</p>\n<p>- Victim-perpetrator relationship (current or former intimate partner, other family member, work colleague, school peer, other)</p>\n<p>- type of reporting authority</p>\n<p>When the proposed module on experience and reporting of physical, psychological and sexual violence is part of a larger population survey, relevant disaggregations (e.g., sex, age, etc.) may not need to be included in the module since they are typically part of large socio-economic surveys. In contrast, disaggregations by type of violence, victim-perpetrator relationship and type of reporting authority need to be included in the question module itself.</p>\n<p>To promote not only the measurement of the indicator, but to also better understand crime reporting and recording practices. The LACSI questionnaire recommends an additional follow-up question to confirm if the victim, after reporting the crime to the police/competent authority, signed a legal paper or a formal document which states that his/her report was recorded. This follow-up question is useful for comparing violence reporting data derived from the survey against police/competent authority records, and for identifying possible gaps between violence reporting and violence recording by the police/competent authority.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-11\">10</sup><p> To learn more about which countries have implemented national or subnational stand-alone crime victimization surveys, visit the UNODC-INEGI Center of Excellence Atlas on Victimization Surveys: https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/atlas-on-cvs/ <a href=\"#footnote-ref-11\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-12\">11</sup><p> Technical assistance for the implementation of LACSI methodology in the Latin America and the Caribbean region is provided by the UNODC-INEGI Center of Excellence in Statistical Information on Government, Crime, Victimization and Justice (CoE).
