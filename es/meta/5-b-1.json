The indicator&#x2019;s definition and methodology were developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups, and following an extensive consultation process with countries. Data for the proportion of individuals owning a mobile phone were first collected in 2015 through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to National Statistical Offices (NSO). In this questionnaire, through which ITU already collects several ICT indicators, ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years&#x2019; data and other relevant country-level indicators (ICT and economic).</p>\n<p>Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period, or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note.

However, not every person uses or owns a mobile-cellular telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for professional purposes. Several studies have highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth.</p>\n<p>Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that fewer women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile phone ownership to track and improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>While the data on the &#x2018;proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone&#x2019; currently only exist for very few countries, ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national household surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development&#x2019;s Core List of Indicators. The number of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in the near future.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household surveys. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope individuals who own a mobile phone by the total number of in-scope individuals.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>[</mo>\n    <mo>(</mo>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>m</mi>\n    <mi>b</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>f</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mi>c</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>w</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>g</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>m</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>b</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>h</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mo>)</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>/</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>(</mo>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>m</mi>\n    <mi>b</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>f</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mi>c</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mo>)</mo>\n    <mo>]</mo>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Data are submitted by Member States to The International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
