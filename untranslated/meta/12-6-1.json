This is to ensure that the focus of the indicator is on tracking the publishing of sustainability information, rather than on the practice of publishing stand-alone sustainability reports. It also ensures that the indicator interpretation is aligned with the wording of Target 12.6 which refers to promoting &#x201C;the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>Not every report called &#x2018;Sustainability Report&#x2019; will be counted towards the indicator. In order to be counted, they will have to comply with a &#x2018;minimum requirement&#x2019; in terms of sustainability disclosures reported on (see below).</p>\n<p><u>Company:</u></p>\n<p>While many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability reports. As a practice that should be encouraged, and one that is useful to monitor, is therefore proposed to count both the group and subsidiary/franchise level separately, as separate entities. &#x201C;Company&#x201D; can therefore apply to either the parent company, or a franchise or subsidiary, depending on their reporting practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>It is proposed that, to be counted towards the indicator, companies must publish information that meets a &#x201C;Minimum requirement&#x201D; of disclosure. A core set of economic, environmental, social and governance disclosures of sustainability information is therefore identified. In defining these disclosure elements, the custodian agencies attempted to align with the disclosures that appear in existing related reporting frameworks, including the IIRC reporting framework, the Global Reporting Initiative Standard (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) (see Annex I for a comparison of the various sustainability disclosures contained under each.</p>\n<p>It also attempts to align with the UNCTAD Core Indicators for company reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. UNCTAD has prepared Guidance on Core indicators for entity reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support entities in the provision of information under indicator 12.6.1 and governments in assessing the private sector contribution to the SDGs. The Guidance reflects the Agreed Conclusions of the thirty-fourth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR), which in 2017 requested UNCTAD to develop the guiding document. The UNCTAD Guidance includes detailed definitions and data sources for the core indicators in the company accounts to assist the entities in the reporting.</p>\n<p>The purpose is not to create a new reporting standard or framework, but to ensure that the minimum requirement for Indicator 12.6.1 is aligned with existing global frameworks currently used by companies, so that they may continue to use these frameworks and be counted towards the indicator.</p>\n<p>While establishing a minimum requirement in terms of reporting ensures that only companies disclosing meaningful information on all aspects of sustainability are counted towards the indicator, it could be perceived as giving the message that the minimum suffices and that companies do not need to go beyond it. </p>\n<p>Therefore, it is proposed that the methodology include an advanced level, with a further set of disclosure elements which would further provide impetus for examining and reporting on the sustainability practices and impacts of the company. These include: 1) stakeholder engagement, 2) assessing impacts beyond the company boundaries and along the supply chain; 3) supplier and consumer engagement on sustainability issues; 4) procurement and sourcing practices; and 5) environmental performance information in the form of intensity values to be monitored over time, such as consumption of energy, water or materials per unit of production or per unit of profit.</p>\n<p>Having different levels will also allow for information to be collected on the degree of reporting of different companies, including whether the same companies produce more ambitious reports, and go further in their sustainability practices with time, such as through supplier engagement. It would allow for companies who are beginning to produce sustainability reports to be counted towards the indicator once they achieve the minimum level, but provide incentive, through their inclusion in the indicator count, for them to work towards more ambitious reporting and demonstrate their progress over time.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Number of companies</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<ol>\n  <li>Existing global and national repositories of sustainability reports (see tentative list in Annex II)</li>\n  <li>Data provided by national governments </li>\n</ol>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li>The custodian agencies propose to establish a global platform or database which would: </li>\n  <li>Collate and analyse sustainability reports through advanced analytics to determine coherence with the minimum requirement and advanced level</li>\n  <li>Provide country specific information </li>\n  <li>Aggregate data at sub-regional, regional and global levels (avoiding double-counting of the same companies)</li>\n  <li>Disaggregate data (company size, per industry)</li>\n  <li>The Custodian Agencies will mine existing global and national-level report aggregators, to analyse the reports included in their databases.

While Indicator 12.6.1 counts the number of companies producing &#x201C;sustainability reports&#x201D;, the custodian agencies consider the indicator an important opportunity not only to monitor and promote the growth in sustainability reporting globally, but also to monitor and promote high quality reporting, promote the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies, and promote sustainability practices by companies (as mentioned in the Target under which the indicator falls). Attempts have therefore been made to integrate all of these aspects into the methodology, to the extent possible.</p>\n<p>Given the above, the custodian agencies propose an approach whereby:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rather than simply counting the number of companies publishing stand-alone sustainability reports, the indicator methodology will focus on the sustainability information published by a company, whether in the form of a stand-alone sustainability report, or integrated within other company reports, such as the annual report. Therefore, in this respect, for the purposes of this indicator, &#x2018;sustainability report&#x2019; can refer to a stand-alone sustainability report, or sustainability information reported under other formats, such as integrated into the company&#x2019;s annual report.</li>\n  <li>Not every document entitled &#x2018;sustainability report&#x2019; will be counted towards the indicator, given that the quality of these reports varies greatly, and that many may not contain meaningful information on all aspects of sustainability (governance, economic, social and environmental).</li>\n  <li>A minimum requirement is therefore proposed, whereby for a company to be counted towards the indicator, it must have published information on a set of key disclosure elements covering the company&#x2019;s governance practices as well as economic, social and environment impacts. This will ensure that companies who produce sustainability reports that are weak in terms of their disclosure will not be counted and should promote more rigorous reporting.</li>\n</ul>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>N/A</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Companies will be counted towards the indicator if they publish sustainability information covering the following sustainability disclosures:</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Requirement:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Institutional and governance: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Materiality assessment* </li>\n  <li>Sustainability strategy and/or principles related to sustainability</li>\n  <li>Management approach to address materiality topics</li>\n  <li>Governance structure, including for economic, environmental and social issues</li>\n  <li>Key impacts, risks, opportunities </li>\n  <li>Anti-fraud, anti-corruption and anti-competitive behaviour practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Economic:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Direct measure of economic performance (revenue, net profit, value added, payouts to shareholders)</li>\n  <li>Indirect measure of economic performance (community investment, investment in infrastructure or other significant local economic impact)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Energy consumption and energy efficiency</li>\n  <li>Water consumption, wastewater generation, integrated water resource management practices, or water recycling/re-use and efficiency</li>\n  <li>Greenhouse gas emissions</li>\n  <li>Other emissions and effluents, including Ozone-depleting substances, Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), Sulphur Oxides (SOX), and chemicals</li>\n  <li>Waste generation, including hazardous wastes</li>\n  <li>Waste minimisation and recycling practices</li>\n  <li>Use and/or production of hazardous chemicals and substances</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Occupational health and safety</li>\n  <li>Total number of employees, by contract type and gender</li>\n  <li>Employee training </li>\n  <li>Unfair and illegal labour practices and other human rights considerations</li>\n  <li>Diversity, equal opportunity and discrimination in governance bodies and among employees</li>\n  <li>Worker rights and collective agreements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The methodology will make allowance for application of the <strong><u>&#x2018;comply or explain&#x2019; principle for the minimum standard</u></strong>, which allows reporting entities to highlight why certain disclosures are not relevant for their specific company and make it more accessible to small companies.
