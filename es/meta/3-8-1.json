However, administrative data, facility data, facility surveys, and sentinel surveillance systems are utilized for certain indicators. Underlying data sources for each of the 14 tracer indicators are explained in more detail in Annex 1. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In terms of values used to compute the index, values are taken from existing published sources. This includes assembled data sets and estimates from various UN agencies. This is summarized in the above link. </p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>The mechanisms for collecting data from countries vary across the 14 tracer indicators, however in many cases a UN agency or interagency group has assembled and analysed relevant national data sources and then conducted a formal country consultation with country governments to review or produce comparable country estimates. For the UHC service coverage index, once this existing information on the 14 tracer indicators is collated, WHO conducts a country consultation with nominated focal points from national governments to review inputs and the calculation of the index. WHO does not undertake new estimation activities to produce tracer indicator values for the service coverage index; rather, the index is designed to make use of existing and well-established indicator data series to reduce reporting burden. </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Data collection varies from every 1 to 5 years across tracer indicators. For example, country data on immunizations and HIV treatment are reported annually, whereas household surveys to collect information on child treatment may occur every 3-5 years, depending on the country. More details about individual tracer indicators are available in Annex 1. </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>The first release of baseline values for the UHC service coverage index took place in December 2017. Updates are released every two years. </p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>In most cases, Ministries of Health and National Statistical Offices oversee data collection and reporting for health service coverage indicators. </p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>The World Health Organization, drawing on inputs from other international agencies. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 3.8 is defined as &#x201C;Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all&#x201D;. The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage and indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household&#x2019;s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Countries provide many essential services for health protection, promotion, prevention, treatment and care. Indicators of service coverage &#x2013; defined as people receiving the service they need &#x2013; are the best way to track progress in providing services under universal health coverage (UHC). Since a single health service indicator does not suffice for monitoring UHC, an index is constructed from 14 tracer indicators selected based on epidemiological and statistical criteria. This includes several indicators that are already included in other SDG targets, thereby minimizing the data collection and reporting burden. The index is reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the optimal value. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>These tracer indicators are meant to be indicative of service coverage, not a complete or exhaustive list of health services and interventions that are required for universal health coverage. The 14 tracer indicators were selected because they are well-established, with available data widely reported by countries (or expected to become widely available soon). Therefore, the index can be computed with existing data sources and does not require initiating new data collection efforts solely to inform the index. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The index is computed with geometric means, based on the methods used for the Human Development Index. The calculation of the 3.8.1 indicator requires first preparing the 14 tracer indicators so that they can be combined into the index, and then computing the index from those values. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The 14 tracer indicators are first all placed on the same scale, with 0 being the lowest value and 100 being the optimal value. For most indicators, this scale is the natural scale of measurement, e.g., the percentage of infants who have been immunized ranges from 0 to 100 percent. However, for a few indicators additional rescaling is required to obtain appropriate values from 0 to 100, as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rescaling based on a non-zero minimum to obtain finer resolution (this &#x201C;stretches&#x201D; the distribution across countries): prevalence of non-raised blood pressure and prevalence of non-use of tobacco are both rescaled using a minimum value of 50%. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>rescaled non raised blood pressure = (X-40) / (100-40) * 100 </p>\n<p>rescaled tobacco non-use = (X-30)/(100-30)*100</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rescaling for a continuous measure: mean fasting plasma glucose, which is a continuous measure (units of mmol/L), is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 using the minimum theoretical biological risk (5.1 mmol/L) and observed maximum across countries (7.1 mmol/L). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>rescaled value = (7.1 - original value) / (7.1-5.1) * 100 </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Maximum thresholds for rate indicators: hospital bed density and health workforce density are both capped at maximum thresholds, and values above this threshold are held constant at 100. These thresholds are based on minimum values observed across OECD countries. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>rescaled hospital beds per 10,000 = minimum (100, original value / 18*100) </p>\n<p>rescaled physicians per 1,000 = minimum (100, original value / 0.9*100) </p>\n<p>rescaled psychiatrists per 100,000 = minimum (100, original value / 1*100) </p>\n<p>rescaled surgeons per 100,000 = minimum (100, original value / 14*100) </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once all tracer indicator values are on a scale of 0 to 100, geometric means are computed within each of the four health service areas, and then a geometric mean is taken of those four values. If the value of a tracer indicator happens to be zero, it is set to 1 (out of 100) before computing the geometric mean.

</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note that in countries with low malaria burden, the tracer indicator for use of insecticide-treated nets is dropped from the calculation. </p>\n<p> </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The starting point for computing the index is to assemble existing information for each tracer indicator. In many cases, this involves using country time series that have been produced or collated by UN agencies in consultation with country governments (e.g., immunization coverage, access to sanitation, HIV treatment coverage, etc). Some of these published time series involve mathematical modelling to reconcile multiple data sources or impute missing values, and these details are summarized in Annex 1. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After assembling these inputs, there are still missing values for some country-years for some indicators. Calculating the UHC service coverage index requires values for each tracer indicator for a country, so some imputation is necessary to fill these data gaps. The current approach involves a simple imputation algorithm. For each indicator: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If a country has missing values between two years with values, linear interpolation is used to fill missing values for the intervening years </li>\n  <li>If a country has historical years with values, but no current value, constant extrapolation is used to fill missing values to the current year </li>\n  <li>If a country has no values, a value is imputed. For pneumonia care-seeking and density of surgeons, a regression is fit to impute missing values (see Annex 1 for details). For all other indicators, a regional median is calculated to impute missing values. Regions are based on World Bank geographic regions, with a separate grouping of traditional high-income countries<sup>1</sup> </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given the timing and distribution of various health surveys and other data collection mechanisms, countries do not collect and report on all 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage on an annual basis. In addition, monitoring at country level is most suitably done at broader time intervals, e.g., every 5 years, to allow for new data collection across indicators. Therefore, the extent to which imputation has been used to fill missing information should be communicated along with the index value. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any needed imputation is done at country level. These country values can then be used to compute regional and global ones. </p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Regional and global aggregates use United Nations population estimates at the country level to compute a weighted average of country values for the index. This is justified because UHC is a property of countries, and the index of essential services is a summary measure of access to essential services for each country&#x2019;s population. United Nations population estimates at country level are used to ensure consistency and comparability of estimates within countries and between countries over time. </p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Summarizing data availability for the UHC service coverage index is not straightforward, as different data sources are used across the 14 tracer indicators. Additionally, for many indicators comparable estimates have been produced, in many cases drawing on different types of underlying data sources to inform the estimates while also using projections to impute missing values. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>A baseline value for the UHC service coverage index for 2015 across 183 countries was published in late 2017. As part of this process, data sources going back to 2000 were assembled. In 2019, UHC service coverage index were estimates for the years: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017. In 2021, the index is estimated for all years from 2000 to 2019 and for all countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Equity is central to the definition of UHC, and therefore the UHC service coverage index should be used to communicate information about inequalities in service coverage within countries. This can be done by presenting the index separately for the national population vs disadvantaged populations to highlight differences between them. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For countries, geographic location is likely the most feasible dimension for sub-national disaggregation based on average coverage levels measured with existing data sources. To do this, the UHC index can be computed separately by, e.g., province or urban vs rural residence, which would allow for subnational comparisons of service coverage. Currently, the most readily available data for disaggregation on other dimensions of inequality, such as household wealth, is for indicators of coverage within the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health services category. Inequality observed in this dimension can be used as a proxy to understand differences in service coverage across key inequality dimensions. This approach should be replaced with full disaggregation of all 14 tracer indicators once data are available to do so. </p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>The service coverage index draws on existing, publicly available data and estimates for tracer indicators. These numbers have already been through a country consultation process (e.g., for immunization coverage), or are taken directly from country reported data.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL: </strong><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/en/</u></a> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References: </strong><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/</u></a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(17)30472-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(17)30472-2.pdf</u></a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/en/</u></a> </p>\n<p>For historical development of methods, see: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/UHC_WHS2016_TechnicalNote_May2016.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/UHC_WHS2016_TechnicalNote_May2016.pdf?ua=1</u></a> (superseded by this document) </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2015/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2015/en/</u></a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2014/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2014/en/</u></a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://collections.plos.org/uhc2014\" target=\"_blank\"><u>http://collections.plos.org/uhc2014</u></a> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Annex 1: Metadata for tracer indicators used to measure the coverage of essential health services for monitoring SDG indicator 3.8.1.</p>\n<p>Please send any comments or queries to: uhc_stats@who.int</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Tracer area</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Family planning</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Indicator definition</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Percentage of women of reproductive age (15&#x2212;49 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Numerator</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number of women aged 15-49 who are married or in-union who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using a modern method of contraception </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Denominator</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number of women aged 15-49 who are married or in-union with a need for family planning </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Main data sources</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Population-based health surveys</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Method of measurement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Household surveys include a series of questions to measure the modern contraceptive prevalence rate and need for family planning.

Linear regression is used to provide estimates of the population using improved sanitation facilities, as well as the proportion practising open defecation. Regressions are also made to estimate the population using improved sanitation facilities connected to sewers and septic tanks; these are constrained to not exceed the estimates for total improved facilities. The proportion of the population sharing sewered and non-sewered sanitation facilities is estimated by taking an average of all available data on sharing from household surveys and censuses. Basic sanitation services are calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population using improved sanitation facilities by the proportion of improved sanitation facilities which are not shared among two or more households. Separate estimates are made for urban and rural areas, and national estimates are generated as weighted averages of the two, using population data from the most recent report of the United Nations Population Division. The most recent household survey or census available for most countries was typically conducted two to six years ago. The JMP extrapolates regressions for two years beyond the last available data point. Beyond this point the estimates remain unchanged for up to four years unless coverage is below 0.5 per cent or above 99.5 per cent, in which case the line is extended indefinitely.

A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966&#x2013;976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Prevalence of tobacco non-use is computed as 1 minus the prevalence of tobacco use.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Tracer area</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Hospital access</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Indicator definition</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per 10,000 population</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Numerator</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number of hospital beds (should exclude labor and delivery beds)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Denominator</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Total population</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Main data sources</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Administrative systems / Health facility reporting system</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Method of measurement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Country administrative systems are used to total the number of hospital beds, which are divided by the total estimated population, and multiplied by 10,000. </p>\n        <p>WHO regional offices and other groups collect information on national hospital bed density, including the following online resources:</p>\n        <p>WHO EMRO regional observatory: https://rho.emro.who.int/rhodata/node.main.A36</p>\n        <p>WHO AFRO regional observatory: http://www.aho.afro.who.int/en/data-statistics/hospital-beds-10-000-population</p>\n        <p>WHO EURO European Health for All Database: https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/datasets/european-health-for-all-database/</p>\n        <p>OECD: https://data.oecd.org/healtheqt/hospital-beds.htm</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Method of estimation</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Using available data, the indicator is computed relative to a threshold value of 18 hospital beds per 10,000 population.

This rescaling is done in the same way as that for the hospital bed density indicator described above, resulting in indicator values that range from 0 to 100 for each of the three cadres. For example, using country data on physicians per 1000 population (<em>x</em>), the cadre-specific indicator would be computed as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Country with <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = <em>x</em> /0.9*100. </li>\n          <li>Country with <em>x</em> &gt;= 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = 100.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>As a final step, the geometric mean of the three cadre-specific indicator values is computed to obtain the final indicator of health workforce density.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The &#x201C;physicians&#x201D; category would ideally be expanded to include all &#x201C;core health professionals&#x201D;, such as nurses and midwives.
