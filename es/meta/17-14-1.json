The policy coherence mechanisms set out in this methodology may therefore include mechanisms already in place before the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, and any mechanisms established during the next decade leading up to 2030 should aim to continue well beyond that timeframe. However, given the role of Agenda 2030 and the individual goals in defining the specific parameters of sustainable development, it is likely that governments will focus, in implementing this methodology, on bringing coherence in their policy approaches to implement the goals. </p>\n<p><em>The concept of Policy Coherence: </em>The textual formulation of the indicator covers &#x201C;policy coherence&#x201D;. In order to make the indicator universally applicable and adaptable to various national contexts, the mechanisms measured by the methodology cover a wide range of mechanisms that, although aiming to achieve the same objective, use slightly different language. In order to properly assess and report on this indicator similar concepts such as &#x201C;whole of government approach or &#x201C;integrated approach&#x201D; will be interpreted in the same spirit as the concept of &#x201C;policy coherence&#x201D;. However, it is important that the used concept considers policies that cover the various dimensions of sustainable development. Hence, a mechanism focusing solely on the concept of policy coherence for development (which is often limited to coherence between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and other policies, in the spirit of the Millennium Development Goals) will not be considered by this framework. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Percent</p>\n<p>Number</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data provided by national governments, including entities responsible for SDG implementation</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Through a Government Survey (self-scoring by Governments according to the above table). </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>First data collection: Expected in early 2021.

This methodology aims to provide a basis for countries to engage in discussions around what policy coherence means at the national level and how it could be improved. Such discussions and strategies to improve policy coherence that may results from it could feed into a country Voluntary National Review (VNR) or National Development Strategy or Plan development, to inform further efforts by the country to improve its ability to implement Agenda 2030 through better policy coherence. This document should be considered a living document which is regularly updated with the country experiences in putting in place and assessing mechanisms for policy coherence. These experiences, and related challenges, lessons learned and solutions, can be shared so that UNEP as custodian agency, with partners, can further refine this methodology and disseminated it not only as a tool to enable effective reporting but also to support national efforts toward policy coherence.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>UNEP has developed a composite indicator framework for SDG 17.14.1 based on initial research on existing work, literature, partners and existing indicators on similar issues. This indicator includes 8 domains. Each is scored on a 0-10 point scale. The percentage of points out of the total 80 points is then computed for each country. It is recommended that Governments convene a stakeholder group for self-scoring. The below table can be used for scoring.
