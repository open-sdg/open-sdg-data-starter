These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use of kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home.

During the process of updating and disseminating the clean cooking estimates, the WHO is responsible for acting in consultation with SDG 7 custodian agencies, national statistics agencies, and the UN regional commissions.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Cooking, lighting and heating represent a large share of household energy use across the low- and middle-income countries. For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than Tuberculosis, Human Immuno-deficiency Virus and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General&#x2019;s Sustainable Energy for All initiative.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator uses the type of primary fuels and technologies used for cooking, heating, and lighting as a practical surrogate for estimating human exposure to household (indoor) air pollution and its related disease burden, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. However, epidemiological studies provide a science-based evidence for establishing those estimates using these surrogates.</p>\n<p>The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel and stove for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating with polluting fuels can also be a contributor to household (indoor) air pollution levels. In addition, lighting with kerosene, a very polluting and hazardous fuel is also often used, and in some countries is the main fuel used for cooking.</p>\n<p>While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking household energy access for cooking fuel, it also presents limitations that will need to be addressed over time. Currently there is a limited amount of available data capturing the type of fuel and devices used in the home for heating and lighting. Accordingly, WHO in cooperation with World Bank, and the Global Alliance for Clean Cook stoves, led a survey enhancement process with representatives from country statistical offices and national household surveying agencies (e.g. Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Living Standards Measurement Survey) to better gather efficiently and harmoniously information on the fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. The efforts concluded in the creation of 6 new questions that will replace and slightly expand the current set of questions commonly used on national multipurpose surveys to assess household energy.</p>\n<p>Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7 and harnesses the normative guidance in the WHO guidelines to benchmark tiers of energy access. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous international agencies working in the field. The 2020 estimates provided include data extracted from these surveys. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 1440 nationally representative survey and censuses.

Using household survey data as inputs, the model jointly estimates primary reliance on 6 specific fuel types: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>unprocessed biomass (e.g. wood), </li>\n  <li>charcoal, </li>\n  <li>coal, </li>\n  <li>kerosene, </li>\n  <li>gaseous fuels (e.g. LPG), and </li>\n  <li>electricity; and a final category including other clean fuels (e.g. alcohol). </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Estimates of the proportion of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology (SDG indicator 7.1.2) are then derived by aggregating the estimates for primary reliance on clean fuel types from the model.

Surveys were also discarded if the sum of all mutually exclusive categories reported was not within 97.9-102.1%. Fuel use values were uniformly scaled (divided) by the sum of all mutually exclusive categories excluding &#x201C;missing&#x201D;, &#x201C;no cooking&#x201D; and &#x201C;other fuels&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Countries classified as high-income according to the World Bank country classification (80 countries) in the 2020 fiscal year were assumed to have fully transitioned to clean household energy and therefore are reported as &gt;95% access to clean technologies.</p>\n<p>No estimates were reported for low- and middle-income countries without data (Bulgaria, Lebanon and Libya).

For tracking SDG7 in 2018 and 2019 this model was used to estimate polluting and clean fuel use, though this time it was implemented in the Bayesian framework for increased robustness and more reliable quantification of uncertainty. For 2020, the model has been expanded to allow estimates for individual fuels, and extra flexibility has been added to the functions of time to better capture nonlinear trends in some countries (Stoner et al. 2020). These refinements have been introduced alongside an ever-expanding collection of data, which underwent a major quality-control effort. Due to the increased data availability, borrowing of information across regions is no longer essential, hence time is now the only covariate. </p>\n<p>On both occasions where the model changed, the WHO conducted a thorough sensitivity analysis, including full country-by-country comparisons of estimates between the existing model and the candidate model. In most cases, estimates of the proportion using clean fuels exhibited little change, see annex below. Where larger discrepancies were identified, they were carefully investigated to determine the likely cause. Many of these were in fact the result of the new model better capturing nonlinear trends.</p>\n<p>The same model is used for the 2022 revision, with updated data inputs as described in previous sections.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/household-air-pollution</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Global Tracking Framework report (2013)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://trackingenergy4all.worldbank.org/\">http://trackingenergy4all.worldbank.org/</a> </p>\n<p>Global Tracking Framework Report (2015)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://trackingenergy4all.worldbank.org/\">http://trackingenergy4all.worldbank.org/</a> </p>\n<p>Global Tracking Framework database (2015)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/sustainable-energy-for-all\">http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/sustainable-energy-for-all</a> </p>\n<p>Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.esmap.org/node/55526\">https://www.esmap.org/node/55526</a> </p>\n<p>WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: Household Fuel Combustion, WHO (2014) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548885\">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548885</a></p>\n<p>Stoner, O., Shaddick, G., Economou, T., Gumy, S., Lewis, J., Lucio, I., Ruggeri, G., &amp; Adair-Rohani H.
