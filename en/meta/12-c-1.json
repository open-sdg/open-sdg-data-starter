The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office&#x2019;s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products.

Those that meet the SNA definition of &#x201C;subsidies&#x201D; &#x2013; i.e., subsidies on products, and other subsidies on production &#x2013; can also be found in a country&#x2019;s System of National Accounts. Budget documents are publicly available for most countries. The degree to which information on individual programmes is itemized in those reports is highly variable, however. Support to corporations involved in energy production or transformation may sometimes be found in their annual reports, for example.

Some countries do this exercise already, and report the annual value of those tax features in their periodic tax-expenditure reports.

For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their promotion through subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key goals, such as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality, providing access to energy, and addressing climate change. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that poor households that are particularly vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy. Energy-dependent sectors of the economy can be affected, particularly by abrupt changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore requires careful analysis and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil fuel subsidies to sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost to reaching the SDGs. </p>\n<p>Awareness and understanding of existing subsidies based on credible data is necessary to increase transparency and inform decision-making. Reporting against a global indicator measuring consumer and producer fossil fuel subsidies provides a global picture that encompasses both consumer and producer subsidies. It allows for tracking of national and global trends and serve as an important guide for policy-making. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 12.c.1 requires capacity within national statistical systems to evaluate direct and indirect transfers of government funds. Data collection by the statistical agencies from the sectoral ministries and state-owned enterprises, including at the sub-national level, which depends on their capacity. There is a need for additional training materials and sharing of experiences on the indicator.</p>\n<p>The indicator methodology utilizes a phased monitoring to allow for countries with different capacities to engage in monitoring 12.c.1. The two phases include global monitoring based on price gap estimates plus national monitoring of direct and indirect transfers with optional monitoring of tax expenditure foregone.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>It is proposed that countries report on the subsidy categories listed below as sub-indicators.</p>\n<p>- Direct transfers; </p>\n<p>- Induced transfers (reporting on regulated prices and calculation of the total amount);</p>\n<p>- Tax expenditure, other government revenue foregone and under-pricing of goods and services, including risk (optional). </p>\n<p>The last category should be included as an optional sub-indicator. Each sub-indicator should be expressed in national currency or United States dollars in current prices. UN Environment will use market exchange rates to calculate between national currency and United States dollar. </p>\n<p>Care should be given if a country chooses to aggregate across the three sub-indicators in order to avoid double counting and all three sub-indicators should be publicly available to ensure transparency. Care needs to be taken when aggregating estimates of induced transfers with data on direct transfers and some measures in under-pricing of goods and services. </p>\n<p>Estimates of subsidies to consumers observable through price-gaps (i.e., consumer price support) have been calculated by several international organizations (IADB, IEA, and IMF), covering different geographic regions and time-periods. The three organisations that produce these estimates use roughly the same approach, which can be summed up by the following equation:</p>\n<p>Consumer price support = (adjusted net-of-tax reference unit price &#x2013; local net-of-tax unit price) x units subsidized</p>\n<p>Estimates are based on reference prices on import (or export) parity prices using the price of a product at the nearest international hub, adjusted for quality differences if necessary, plus (or minus) the cost of freight and insurance to the net importer (or back to the net exporter), plus the cost of internal distribution and marketing and any value-added tax (VAT). For tradable commodities (mainly coal, crude oil, and petroleum products), the reference prices are based on the spot price at the nearest international hub &#x2013; e.g., the United States, Northwest Europe, or Singapore.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Data sent to UNEP will be monitored and verified for quality with the help of institutional partners, before being transmitted to the UNSD.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Missing values are not imputed.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>A price gap method is used to create national, regional and global estimates.</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>The methodology used for the calculation of the regional/global aggregates from the country values is available at <a href=\"http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf\">http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf</a>. </p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p><a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/28111/FossilFuel.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/28111/FossilFuel.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y</a> </p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>See 4.d.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>See 4.d.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>See 4.d.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>An initial baseline data assessment of data availability demonstrates that 99 countries have existing data which can be used to estimate fossil fuels from direct transfer and many of these countries also have information on tax revenue foregone.
