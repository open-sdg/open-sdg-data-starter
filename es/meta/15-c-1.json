The basic fields necessary for the global indicator (species, product, and unit) are well established and present in every seizure. Some unit conversions (e.g. logs to MT to m3 for timber) are necessary for some products. For many commodities, for instance trade in live animals and trophies, it is possible to aggregate based on &#x201C;whole individuals&#x201D;. To do regional or national breakdowns, however, data on the source of the shipment are necessary (as the impact of poaching pertains to the source country, not the seizure country), and these data are not available for every seizure.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>The first tranche of data from the Illicit Trade Report should be available in November 2017. </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>To be determined</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>The CITES Management Authority of each country</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>UNODC and UNEP-WCMC</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<p>There are over 35,000 species under international protection, so it is impossible to monitor all poaching. Illegal trade, however, is an indirect indicator of poaching. Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances of illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable. In addition, the number of species under international protection continues to grow. Legal international trade in protected species, by definition, is 100% captured in the CITES Trade Database, which now contains over 16 million records of trade in CITES-listed species. To ground the illegal trade data in a complete indicator, the ratio of aggregated seizures to total trade is estimated. An increase in the share of total wildlife trade that is illegal would be interpreted as a negative indicator, and a decrease as a positive one.</p>\n<p>Because the illegal wildlife trade represents thousands of distinct products, a means of aggregation is necessary. The legal trade value does not represent the true black market value of the items seized, nor the true value of the legal shipments, because it is derived from a single market source (US LEMIS). It does, however, present a logical and consistent means of aggregating unlike products.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Seizures are an incomplete indicator of trafficking, and subject to considerable volatility. Universal coverage is not presently available, although 120 countries are represented in the present database.
