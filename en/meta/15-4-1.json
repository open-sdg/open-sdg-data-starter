The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of mountain ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.</p>\n<p>Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.</p>\n<p>This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of mountain area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. </p>\n<p>2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.</p>\n<p>The indicator was used to track progress towards the 2011&#x2013;2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010). It has been proposed as an indicator for monitoring progress towards the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD 2020b).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the WDPA. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the WDPA. Discrepancies between the data in the WDPA and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the WDKBA (BirdLife International 2019).</p>\n<p>The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 </p>\n<p>(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to &#x201C;green listing&#x201D; have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.</p>\n<p>Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area or the CBD definition of an OECM. However, given that both are incorporated into the indicator, misclassifications (as one or the other) do not impact the calculated indicator value.</p>\n<p>Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of KBA sites (IUCN 2016) across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise less than 50% of the species for which KBAs have been identified, and as KBA identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.</p>\n<p>KBA identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or &#x201C;irreplaceability&#x201D;) using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n<p>Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of mountain KBAs through application of the KBA standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) increased documentation of Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures in the World Database of OECMs.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC &amp; IUCN 2020), digital polygons for Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures from the World Database on OECMs and digital polygons for mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified as mountain Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and a mountain raster layer (UNEP-WCMC 2002), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a mountain Key Biodiversity Area where it had &#x2265;5% overlap with the mountain layer. The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas and/or Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures.</p>\n<p>Protected areas lacking digital boundaries in the World Database of Protected Areas, and those sites with a status of &#x2018;proposed&#x2019; or &#x2018;not reported&#x2019; are omitted. Degazetted sites are not kept in the WDPA and are also not included. Man and Biosphere Reserves are also excluded as these often contain potentially unprotected areas. Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. </p>\n<p>Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Protected Areas and OECMs are validated through dialogue with the governing authority, who signs a data contributor agreement that these sites are, to the best of their knowledge, an accurate depiction of the sites in question.

Anyone with appropriate data may propose a site as a KBA, although consultation with relevant stakeholders at the local and national level is required when identifying the site and needs to be documented in the proposal. In order to propose a site as a KBA, a proposer must apply the KBA criteria to data on biodiversity elements (species and ecosystems) at the site. Associated with the proposal process is the need to delineate the site accurately so that its boundaries are clear. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a KBA, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. The formal proposal is then made using a proposal process that ensures there is an independent review of the proposal before a site is incorporated in the WDKBA. This is important given that KBA status of a site may lead to changes in actions of governments, private sector companies and other institutions following consultation as appropriate. </p>\n<p>KBA identification builds off the existing network of KBAs, including those identified as (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of over 115 national organisations (https://www.birdlife.org/who-we-are/), (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites by 93 national and international organisations in the Alliance (<a href=\"http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html\">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>), and (c) other KBAs by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<a href=\"http://www.cepf.net\">http://www.cepf.net</a> ), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites.</p>\n<p>The main steps of the KBA identification process are the following: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a KBA to Regional Focal Points; </li>\n  <li>Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified KBAs in the country, either through national KBA Coordination Groups or independently;</li>\n  <li>review of proposed KBAs by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and</li>\n  <li>a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the KBAs Secretariat.

Data quality is ensured through wide stakeholder engagement in the KBA proposal process, data checking by Regional Focal Points, formal Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominations by the KBA Secretariat. </p>\n<p>In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent KBA Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of KBA, and oversees a formal Procedure for handling of appeals against the identification of KBAs (see http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/1b388c918e14c5f4c3d7a0237eb0d366).</p>\n<p>Before submission to the UN SDG Indicators database the annually updated indicators of coverage of KBAs by protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are incorporated into updated Country Profiles on the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (<a href=\"https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles\">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>) and then sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), National Statistics Offices SDG Representatives and UN Permanent Missions (Geneva) representatives. </p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>High.</p>\n<p>Each custodian agency is responsible for quality management of their own database.<br>Quality assessment of the indicator is shared between the indicator custodian agencies.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis. Index values for each country are available in the UN SDG Indicators Database <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/\">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/</a>. Graphs of Protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas are also available for each country in the BIP Indicators Dashboard (<a href=\"https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html\">https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html</a>), and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool Country Profiles (<a href=\"https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles\">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>).</p>\n<p>Underlying data on protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are available at <a href=\"http://www.protectedplanet.net\">www.protectedplanet.net</a>. Data on Key Biodiversity Areas are available at <a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org\">www.keybiodiversityareas.org</a>. Data on subsets of KBAs are available for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas at <a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search\">http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search</a> and for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites at https://zeroextinction.org.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. </p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>National processes provide the data that are incorporated into the WDPA, the WDOECM, and the World Database of KBAs, so there are very few discrepancies between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the WDPA incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. </p>\n<p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unep-wcmc.org/\">http://www.unep-wcmc.org/</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">http://www.birdlife.org/</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\">http://www.iucn.org/</a> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014).
