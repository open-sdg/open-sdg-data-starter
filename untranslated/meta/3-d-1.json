Individual questions are grouped by components and indicators in the questionnaires. States Parties can provide additional information on the questions in the comment boxes. Responses to the questions include marking one appropriate value (Yes, No, or Not Known) or the appropriate percentages. For statistical purposes, the &quot;Not Known&quot; value is computed as a &quot;No&quot; value. The IHR monitoring questionnaire includes the following: IHR01. National legislation, policy and financing; IHR02. Coordination and National Focal Point communications; IHR03. Surveillance; IHR04. Response; IHR05. Preparedness; IHR06. Risk communication; IHR07.

The IHR monitoring questionnaire ( 2010 to 2017) was replaced by the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool &#x2013; SPAR, published in July 2018 also known as SPAR 1st edition. The States Parties used the questionnaire from the 2018 &#x2013; 2020 SPAR reporting cycle. The current questionnaire replaced the SPAR 1st edition and was used by the Member States for 2021. Under each capacity, the indicators were either retained, replaced or added. Historical trends based on the data for similar capacity titles may be taken with caution. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>All data are from the questionnaires submitted by States Parties annually. </p>\n<p>For each of the 15 capacities, one to five indicators are used to measure implementation status. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party&apos;s current status. To move to the next level, all capacities described in previous levels should be in place for each indicator. The score of each indicator level is classified as a percentage of performance along the &quot;1 to 5&quot; scale. e.g. for a country selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1, the indicator level is expressed as: 3/5*100=60%</p>\n<p>CAPACITY LEVEL</p>\n<p>The level of capacity is expressed as the average of all indicators. e.g. for a country selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1 and level 4 for indicator 2.2.
