Indicator 5.6.2 seeks to measure the extent to which countries have national laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education. </p>\n<p>The indicator is a percentage (%) scale of 0 to 100 (national laws and regulations exist to guarantee full and equal access), indicating a country&#x2019;s status and progress in the existence of such National laws and regulations. Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and regulations; it does not measure their implementation. </p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>Laws: laws and statutes are official rules of conduct or action prescribed, or formally recognized as binding, or enforced by a controlling authority that governs the behavior of actors (including people, corporations, associations, government agencies). They are adopted or ratified by the legislative branch of government and may be formally recognized in the Constitution or interpreted by courts. Laws governing sexual and reproductive health are not necessarily contained in one law. </p>\n<p>Regulations: are executive, ministerial, or other administrative orders or decrees. At the municipal level, regulations are sometimes called ordinances. Regulations and ordinances issued by governmental entities have the force of law, although circumscribed by the level of the issuing authority. Under this methodology, only regulations with the national-level application are considered.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Restrictions: many laws and regulations contain restrictions in the scope of their applicability. Such restrictions, which include, though are not limited to, those by age, sex, marital status, and requirement for third party authorization, represent barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education. </p>\n<p>Plural legal systems: are defined as legal systems in which multiple sources of law co-exist. Such legal systems have typically developed over a period because of colonial inheritance, religion, and other socio-cultural factors. Examples of sources of law that might co-exist under a plural legal system include English common law, French civil or other law, statutory law, and customary and religious law. The co-existence of multiple sources of law can create fundamental contradictions in the legal system, which result in barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Guarantee&#x201D; (access): for this methodology, &#x201C;guarantee&#x201D; is understood as a law or regulation that assures a particular outcome or condition. The methodology recognizes that laws can only guarantee &#x201C;in principle&#x201D;; for the outcomes to be fully realized in practice, additional steps, including policy and budgetary measures will need to be in place.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Percent (%)</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Adopted by 179 governments, the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action (PoA) marked a fundamental shift in global thinking on population and development issues.

The indicator measures the legal and regulatory environment across four thematic sections, defined as the key parameters of sexual and reproductive health care, information and education according to these international consensus documents and human rights standards:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Maternity care</li>\n  <li>Contraception services </li>\n  <li>Sexuality education</li>\n  <li>HIV and HPV</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the four thematic areas (sections) is represented by individual components, reflecting topics that are: i) critical from a substantive perspective, ii) span a broad spectrum of sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education, and iii) the subject of national legal and regulatory frameworks. In total, Indicator 5.6.2 measures 13 components, categorized as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>SECTION I: MATERNITY CARE</strong></p>\n<p>Component 1. Maternity care</p>\n<p>Component 2. Life-saving commodities</p>\n<p>Component 3. Abortion</p>\n<p>Component 4. Post-abortion care</p>\n<p><strong>SECTION II: CONTRACEPTION SERVICES</strong></p>\n<p>Component 5.

HIV treatment and care</p>\n<p>Component 12. Confidentiality of health status for men and women living with HIV</p>\n<p>Component 13. HPV vaccine</p>\n<p>For each of the 13 components, information is collected on the existence of i) specific legal <em>enablers</em> (positive laws, and regulations) and ii) specific legal <em>barriers</em><sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup>. Such barriers encompass <em>restrictions</em> to positive laws, and regulations (e.g. by age, sex, marital status and requirement for third party authorization), as well as <em>plural legal systems that contradict</em> co-existing positive laws and regulations. For each component, the specific enablers and barriers on which data are collected are defined as the principle enablers and barriers for that component. Even where positive laws are in place, legal barriers can undermine <em>full and equal</em> access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education; the methodology is designed to capture this.</p>\n<p>The percentage value reflects a country&#x2019;s status and progress in the existence of national laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education. By reflecting the &#x201C;extent to which&#x201D; countries guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education, this indicator allows cross-country comparison and within-country progress over time to be captured. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> United Nations (1994) International Conference on Population and Development: Programme of Action.
