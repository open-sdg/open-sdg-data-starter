Further there are indirect links to &#x201C;malnutrition&#x201D;: Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a thousand million people. A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution to the eradication of hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial in adapting to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions, including climate change. They are the animal breeder&#x2019;s raw material and amongst the farmer&#x2019;s most essential inputs. They are essential for sustainable agricultural production. </p>\n<p>No increase of the percentage of breeds being at risk or being extinct is directly related to &#x201C;halt the loss of biodiversity&#x201D;.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Breed-related information remains far from complete. Across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 61 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown status because of missing population data or lack of recent updates. </p>\n<p>Generally, data collection should be possible in all countries. Updating of population size data at least each 10 years is needed for the definition of the risk classes.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is based on the data contained in FAO&#x2019;s Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources DAD-IS (<a href=\"http://dad.fao.org/\">http://dad.fao.org/</a>). Risk classes are defined based on population sizes of breeds reported to DAD-IS. The risk class is considered to be &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point). </p>\n<p>Species are assigned to two groups. The first group comprises species that have high reproductive capacity, such as pigs, rabbits, guinea pigs and avian species, and the second comprises species that</p>\n<p>have low reproductive capacity, i.e. those belonging to the taxonomical families Bovidae, Equidae, Camelidae and Cervidae.</p>\n<p>The risk status categories are defined as follows (see also FAO. 2013. In vivo conservation of animal genetic resources. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines. No. 14. Rome. Accessible at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf</a>): </p>\n<p><strong><em>Extinct. </em></strong>A breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females remaining and any cryoconserved genetic material that may be available is insufficient for breed reconstitution.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cryoconserved only. </em></strong>Breeds that have no living male or female animals remaining, but for which there is sufficient cryopreserved material to allow for reconstitution of the breed, are assigned to the category cryoconserved only. The ability to reconstitute an otherwise extinct breed depends on the amount of and type of stored germplasm. Requirements differ greatly according to species. Guidance on what constitutes &#x201C;sufficient cryopreserved material&#x201D; is provided in the FAO guidelines <em>Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources</em> (FAO, 2012).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Critical. </em></strong>A breed is categorized as critical if:</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the total number of breeding females is less than or equal to 100 (300 for species with low reproductive capacity); or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the overall population size is less than or equal to 80 (240) and the population trend is increasing and the proportion of females being bred to males of the same breed is greater than 80 percent (i.e. cross-breeding is equal to or less than 20 percent); or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 (360) and the population trend is stable or decreasing; or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five (i.e. <em>&#x394;F </em>is 3 percent or greater).</p>\n<p>If the population trend is unknown, then it is assumed to be stable. Breeds for which demographic characteristics suggest a critical risk of extinction, but that have active conservation programmes (including cryoconservation) in place, or populations that are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions are considered to be &#x201C;critical-maintained&#x201D; for reporting purposes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Endangered. </em></strong>A breed is categorized as endangered if:</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 (300 for species with low reproductive capacity) and less than or equal to 1 000 (3 000); or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the overall population size is greater than 80 (240) and less than 800 (2 400) and increasing in size and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the overall population size is greater than 120 (360) and less than or equal to 1 200 (3 600) and the trend is stable or decreasing; or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five (i.e. <em>&#x394;F </em>is between 1 and 3 percent).</p>\n<p>Once again, if the population trend is unknown, then it is assumed to be stable. Endangered breeds will be assigned to the subcategory &#x201C;endangered-maintained&#x201D; if active conservation programmes are in place or if their populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vulnerable. </em></strong>A breed is categorized as vulnerable if:</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the total number of breeding females is between 1 000 and 2 000 (3 000 and 6 000 for species with low reproductive capacity); or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the overall population size is greater than 800 (2 400) and less than or equal to 1 600 (4 800) and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is greater than 80 percent; or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the overall population size is greater than 1 200 (3 600) and less than or equal to 2 400 (7 200) but stable or decreasing; or</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; </strong>the total number of breeding males is between 20 and 35 (i.e. the <em>&#x394;F </em>is between 0.5 and 1 percent).</p>\n<p>Unreported population trends are assumed to be stable.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Not at risk. </em></strong>A breed is categorized as not at risk if the population status is known and the breed does not fall in the critical or endangered categories (including the respective subcategories) or the vulnerable category.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Unknown. </em></strong>This category is self-explanatory and calls for action.
