As requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 140 Member States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that delivers UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once consolidated, data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and validity.</p>\n<p>The UN-CTS provides specific definitions of data to be collected.

It does so through several Global programmes and through the UNODC field office network.</p>\n<p>UNODC is responsible for carrying out the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), which was introduced through the General Assembly Resolution <a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)\">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972. The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984, further requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The experience of non-sexual and sexual harassment can have far-reaching negative impacts on the victims. Besides the emotional and psychological harm suffered, harassment can have negative consequences on the ability of its victims to fully participate in public life and to share in and contribute to the development of their communities. For example, the widespread occurrence of sexual harassment in the workplace can lead to a lower participation of women in the workforce, especially in male-dominated occupations, and lower their income-generating capacity.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Like other experience-based indicators on victimization, the indicator reflects the experience from the perspective of the victim. As such, the response provided by the victims reflects their experience as well as their subjective feeling of victimization, irrespective of whether actual harm was intended or not. The subjective feeling of victimization is an important component of safety and security across space and time (for example, in cities or in the domestic sphere) and a higher prevalence of experienced non-sexual or sexual harassment indicates a negative environment that warrants appropriate responses and interventions.</p>\n<p>Similar to other survey-based indicators, the scope of the indicator also relies on the design and sampling strategy of the survey. For example, most surveys set a lower age-limit for practical and ethical reasons (e.g. 18 years and older), which means that data are not representative for children (under 18 years).<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup></sup> Harassment specifically linked to disability requires relatively large sample sizes in order to obtain a sufficiently large number of disabled persons in the sample.</p>\n<p>The same behaviour can have different meanings and therefore have a different impact across cultural contexts and population groups. For this reason, the selection of &#x2018;harassment&#x2019; behaviours has been made also with the view of identifying situations of harassment that can be perceived as such across different social and cultural contexts.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-5\">4</sup><p> Other age limits (e.g. 15+ years) may be applied if consistent with national practices. Some surveys are also specifically designed to cover the youth and adolescent population. For example the Social Cohesion Survey to Prevent Violence and Crime (ECOPRED) conducted by the National Statistics Office of Mexico (INEGI) targets youth 12 years and older. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-5\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>This is a survey-based indicator that measures individuals&#x2019; experience of any of a set of behaviours that are collectively referred to as non-sexual harassment and sexual harassment. Questions on non-sexual and sexual harassment are to be measured separately. The results can then be combined.

LACSI is led by UNODC, and it is supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Organization of American States (OAS).

The UNODC-UNECE Manual on Victimization Surveys (2010) is available at: <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Manual-on-victim-surveys.html\">https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Manual-on-victim-surveys.html</a> </p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has a statistical section with dedicated staff to support the data collection through technical assistance, collating and verifying the received data and continuously improve data collection mechanisms including guidelines.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>It is recommended that National Statistics Offices (NSOs) serve as the main contact for compiling and assuring the quality of the necessary data to report on SDG 11.7.2, in close coordination with other relevant bodies in the country.

LACSI goes beyond measuring SDG 2030 survey-based indicators and promotes the measurement of a wide range of dimensions to be measured in terms of safety and victimization that can be of use for policy makers and countries to better understand crime .</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator has recently been included into the annual United Nations Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS, the regular data collection used by UNODC to collect data from UN Member States. It is expected that countries will gradually report on this indicator as the methodological guidance is disseminated and relevant items are included in national surveys.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>When the proposed module on non-sexual and sexual harassment is part of a larger population survey, relevant disaggregations (e.g., income, sex, age group, geographic location, disability status, etc.) may not need to be included in the module since they are typically part of large socio-economic surveys. In contrast, disaggregations by place of occurrence, victim-perpetrator relationship,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup> and reporting of the crime to the police or relevant authorities need to be included in the question module itself.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> To learn more about which countries have implemented national or subnational stand-alone crime victimization surveys, visit the UNODC-INEGI Center of Excellence Atlas on Victimization Surveys: https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/atlas-on-cvs/ <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">8</sup><p> The Latin America and the Caribbean Crime Victimization Survey Initiative (LACSI) also recommends measuring the condition of both the victim and the perpetrator of being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-9\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Data for this indicator are based on a set of standardised survey questions. If data from more than one survey are available for the same country, discrepancies may be due to different wording of the questions, different structure of the questionnaire, different survey methods and operations, different sample design and sample size.
