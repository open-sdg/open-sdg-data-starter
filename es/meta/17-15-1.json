Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government&#x2019;s planning documents. </p>\n<p>The definition of country-owned results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.</p>\n<p>In practice, country-owned results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.</p>\n<p>Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government&#x2019;s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices &amp; sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Percent (%)</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>For developing countries, classification is based on SDG grouping provided by the UN Statistical Office (regional classification, Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS)). </p>\n<p>For development partners, classification is based on SDG grouping. In addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. </p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The monitoring is a voluntary and country-led process. Country governments lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of Finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP support countries in collecting relevant data through the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&apos;s monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned by the country government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Ministry that has a role for managing development cooperation and partnerships in accordance with the respective institutional structure of each country. </p>\n<p>(ii) The national coordinator collects inputs from development partners. The data is submitted to the OECD and UNDP and subsequently undergoes a review round with the headquarters offices of development partners. </p>\n<p>(iii) No adjustments are made to the data after they have undergone the validation process. However, inconsistencies or possible problematic values are highlighted and sent back to national coordinators for revision.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>The data collection calendar was on a biennial cycle prior to 2020.

These representatives coordinate the data collection process at the national level by consolidating data and inputs from providers of development co-operation, civil society organisations, the private sector, and trade unions. For calculation of indicator 17.15.1, country governments submit the data to the OECD/UNDP Joint Support Team of the Global Partnership.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly compile and report the data at the global level.</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>As custodians of this SDG indicator, OECD and UNDP are responsible for providing technical guidance and supporting countries to collect data, compiling and verifying country data, and for submitting the country data and aggregate data for this indicator. Drawing on their institutional support provided to the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, OECD and UNDP leverage country participation in the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, which since 2013 has tracked progress towards the effectiveness principles and is the recognised source of data and evidence on upholding effectiveness commitments, to aggregate global data for this indicator. Countries not participating in the Global Partnership monitoring exercise are able to submit their country data directly to OECD and UNDP. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Measuring the alignment of development partners&#x2019; support to country priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of &#x201C;respect for each country&#x2019;s policy space and leadership to establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>In particular, for interventions approved in the year of reference (i.e. most recent behaviour), the assessment measures the extent to which support from other countries and international organizations set exogenous priorities and conditions to partner countries receiving development co-operation that are not reflected in existing country-led priority-setting mechanisms or planning tools.</p>\n<p>The information collected throughout the indicator provides a &#x201C;two-way mirror&#x201D;, providing both a country-level estimate on a country&#x2019;s existing policy space, and a development partner-level estimate on its degree of alignment with existing results frameworks and priority-setting mechanisms in partner countries where it operates. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The Global Partnership monitoring exercise collects data beyond the scope of the proposed indicator, including additional aspects such as quality of national development planning, the enabling environment of civil society organisations, the quality of public-private dialogue, the predictability of development co-operation, and the use of country public financial management systems by providers of development co-operation. Data generated from the Global Partnership monitoring provide evidence for two additional SDG indicators: 17.16.1 and 5.c.1. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results, indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from government sources &#x2013; including national, sector and subnational planning tools.</p>\n<p>For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are assessed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Q1.

Weighting by project size would otherwise overrepresent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The national coordinator has the main responsibility to validate the project level data reported by respective government institutions development partners and stakeholders. </p>\n<p>At the global level, the OECD and UNDP review the project level data submitted by partner countries in consultation and coordination with countries&#x2019; national coordinators and with providers of development co-operation.</p>\n<p>Details on the validation process can be found at <a href=\"https://www.effectivecooperation.org/content/2018-monitoring-guide-national-co-ordinators\">https://www.effectivecooperation.org/content/2018-monitoring-guide-national-co-ordinators</a>. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At country level</strong></p>\n<p>There is no treatment of missing values.
