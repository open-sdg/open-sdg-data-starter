Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>\n<p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline transport are only available for UNECE or ITF member States.

Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the global transport system.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Coverage for aviation is for all ICAO 191 Member States.</p>\n<p>Coverage for road, rail, inland waterways and pipelines is for all U.N. member States, but these are sourced from official statistics only for UNECE member States and ITF member States (and only when available). </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Aviation</p>\n<p>The aviation passenger and freight volumes are reported for the air carriers through ICAO Air Transport Reporting Forms and grouped by Member States of ICAO.</p>\n<p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>\n<p>Data for each inland mode are reported to UNECE/ITF/Eurostat by member States, through an annual data collection using the transport statistics web common questionnaire.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level </strong></p>\n<p><u>Aviation data are broadly complete.</u></p>\n<p><u>For inland transport statistics:</u> In case of missing data for a country for which at least one data point is available since 2000, we calculate estimates based on the expected growth rate for the country.
