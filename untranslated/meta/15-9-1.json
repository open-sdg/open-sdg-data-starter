Under this article, it is stated that &#x201C;each Party to the Convention shall, in accordance with its particular conditions and capabilities: (a) Develop national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity or adapt for this purpose existing strategies, plans or programmes which shall reflect, <em>inter alia</em>, the measures set out in this Convention relevant to the Contracting Party concerned; and (b) Integrate, as far as possible and as appropriate, the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral or cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies&#x201D;. Further, under Article 26, it is stated that &#x201C;each Contracting Party shall, at intervals to be determined by the Conference of the Parties, present to the Conference of the Parties, reports on measures which it has taken for the implementation of the provisions of this Convention and their effectiveness in meeting the objectives of this Convention&#x201D;.</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong></p>\n<p>Integration of biodiversity values into national accounting and reporting systems can be achieved through implementation of the international statistical standard, the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The SEEA Central Framework (SEEA CF) was adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 2012 as the first international standard for environmental-economic accounting. In addition, the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2021. Results of the Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics provide the data needed for Sub-indicator (b) of the indicator.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Sub-indicator (a) The assessment of national targets has several limitations stemming from the different approaches Parties have taken in setting national targets and in reporting against them. Parties have mapped their national targets to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in different ways and based on different information. For example, some have established one national target for each of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, while others have set multiple national targets for one Aichi Biodiversity Target. Some Parties have set process-related targets, some have set outcome-oriented targets, and some have used a combination of the two. This has necessitated different approaches at the national level in evaluating progress. These varying national approaches are not necessarily comparable. Similarly, some countries have set national targets which relate to multiple Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Further, some Parties have chosen to report against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets rather than towards their national biodiversity targets and some have reported against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as they have not developed distinct national targets. The different approaches in national target-setting and reporting present challenges to undertaking analysis in a systematic manner. </p>\n<p>Sub-indicator (b) The SEEA EA was adopted in March 2021, and the way that the SEEA EA is implemented by countries is expected to develop over time. In addition, the extent to which specific SEEA accounts relate to biodiversity differs, and some accounts relate more directly to biodiversity than others. Thus, the extent to which certain SEEA accounts directly integrate biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems will also differ.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a) </strong></p>\n<p>The sixth national reports provide semi-quantitative information on progress made in achieving the national targets and/or the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which is amenable to the development of a scoring system.
