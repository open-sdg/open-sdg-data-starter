Soil erosed by water - these soils degrade under the influence of water (water erosion).
Salinised -these soils contain easily soluble amounts of toxic salts  in their profile for agricultural crops (salt marshes, salinised soils, alkalis).
Secondary salinised - where the process of accumulation of harmful salts for agricultural crops is conditioned by wrong human economic activity (irrigation equipment, increase of groundwater level as a result of violation of regimes, irrigation with mineralized water, etc.)
Alkalinised - these soils contain a large amount of exchangeable sodium (sometimes magnesium) when absorbed, in the iliuvial horizon.
Unsettled soil - damaged by entrails extraction (quarries, open pit mines, etc.), as it were, soils that are covered with industrial wastes, mining chemicals, etc. These are decommissioned lands that have not been reclaimed.
Hyper - moist soils are completely saturated with water.
Rocky - These are the soils that contain stones of different sizes in their profile.
Contaminated with waste - hese are the soils (areas) that are polluted with various pollutants (industrial, construction, domestic, etc.)
Swampied - these are the soils that have been formed under the influence of special moist (swamp) vegetation in conditions of excess surface or groundwater moisture. 
Deserted - these are the soils where the features (indicators) typical of desert landscapes appear. Desertification is the degradation of lands (territories). "
