The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. </p>\n<p>In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15&#x2013;49 years.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000.

There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths.

There is also some evidence from community studies that women with HIV infection have a higher risk of maternal death, although this may be offset by lower fertility. If HIV is prevalent, there will also be more incidental HIV deaths among pregnant and postpartum women. When estimating maternal mortality in these countries, it is, thus, important to differentiate between incidental HIV deaths (non-maternal deaths) and HIV-related indirect maternal deaths (maternal deaths caused by the aggravating effects of pregnancy on HIV) among HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women who have died (i.e. among all HIV-related deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium).</p>\n<p>The number of HIV-related indirect<strong><em> </em></strong>maternal deaths <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>H</mi>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n  </math>, is estimated by:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>H</mi>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mo>&#x2219;</mo>\n    <mi>E</mi>\n    <mo>&#x2219;</mo>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mo>&#x2219;</mo>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where: </p>\n<p>a*E = the total number of HIV-related deaths among all deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49.</p>\n<p><em>v = </em>is the proportion of HIV-related deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49 that occur during pregnancy.

Adjustments are applied to pregnancy-related deaths to account for these non-maternal deaths.</p>\n<p>The proportion of pregnancy-related deaths among the deaths attributable to mortality shock from crisis is assumed to be equal to the proportion of women in the population who are pregnant or postpartum at the time of the crisis. The proportion of pregnant women in the population is set equal to the general fertility rate, based on the assumption of a one-year period associated with a live birth. Additional uncertainty is added to the estimates of crisis years.</p>\n<p>Adjustment for harmonization of breakdowns:</p>\n<p>Population-based surveys such as DHS and MICS obtain information by interviewing respondents about the survival of their siblings. This approach, commonly referred to as the direct sisterhood method. Given the study design (based on sisters of respondents), the population exposed to risk may be atypical of the population at large. Therefore, we compute an age-standardized value of PM, based on the female population of households at the time of the survey.</p>\n<p>Adjustment for underreporting (unregistered) and misclassification in CRVS systems:</p>\n<p>Underreporting and misclassification in CRVS systems are accounted for with specialized studies. Model estimated country-year specific adjustment factors are obtained and applied to CRVS data.</p>\n<p>Adjustment for under-reporting in non-CRVS and non-specialised sources:</p>\n<p>It is widely believed that some form of upward adjustment is required for population-based surveys to account for deaths early in pregnancy that might not have been captured.

Countries and territories</p>\n<p>included in the analyses are WHO Member States with populations over 100 000, plus two territories (Puerto Rico, and Occupied Palestinian Territory including east Jerusalem).</p>\n<p>The <strong>time series</strong> available is currently 2000 to 2017.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the &#x201C;proportion maternal&#x201D;, or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. </p>\n<p>In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:</p>\n<p>PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 </p>\n<p>and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:</p>\n<p>MMR=PM &#xD7; (All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)</p>\n<p>Where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO Global Health Estimates life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 2019.</p>\n<p>With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.</li>\n  <li>The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined &#x201C;maternal&#x201D; deaths; misclassification; or incompleteness). </li>\n  <li>The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2019, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly, and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. </li>\n  <li>Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk</li>\n</ol>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/\">https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/</a> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children&#x2019;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank Group, United Nations Population Division.
