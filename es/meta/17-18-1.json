The first is to make use of data submitted to the World Bank, International Household Survey Network (IHSN), International Labour Organization (ILO), and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) microdata libraries. Only surveys that are marked as nationally representative are used, and surveys are classified (as either health surveys, agriculture surveys, labor force surveys, etc.) using the classifications submitted to the microdata libraries. The contents of searches on these databases are available in the github repository. The second approach is a manual data collection effort, where national statistical office (NSO) websites have been visited to ensure no surveys were missed. To be included in this search, the survey or census must be publicly available and accessible. If surveys or censuses are missed in this search, the easiest way for a country to get it included would be to create an entry for the survey at one of the microdata libraries. Information on the completeness of the Civil Registry and Vital Statistics (CRVS) is sourced from the UN SDG global monitoring database. Information on whether data is available at the 1st administrative level, for the geospatial indicator, is sourced from Open Data Watch.</p>\n<p>For pillar 5, indicators in the standards and methods pillar are sourced primarily through the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Information on the system of national accounts in use and national accounts base year are sourced through the World Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicaotrs (WDI) metadata.

The appropriate balance between these source types will vary depending on a country&#x2019;s institutional setting and the maturity of its statistical system. High scores should reflect the extent to which the sources being utilized enable the necessary statistical indicators to be generated. For example, a low score on environment statistics (in the data production pillar) may reflect a lack of use of (and low score for) geospatial data (in the data sources pillar). This type of linkage is inherent in the data cycle approach and can help highlight areas for investment required if country needs are to be met.</p>\n<p>The data infrastructure pillar (Pillar 5) includes standards and methods addressing compliance with recognized frameworks and concepts.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>In the data sources pillar (Pillar 4), more information is needed in the areas of administrative data and geospatial data. On administrative data, the picture could be complemented with indicators on whether countries have administrative data systems in place to measure health, education, labor, and social protection program statistics. For the geospatial indicator, the information could be complemented by new measures of how countries are using geospatial information in other ways, for instance using satellite data. And while the world is increasingly awash with private and citizen generated data (e.g., on mobility, job search, or social networking), on a global scale there is no reliable source to measure how national statistical systems are incorporating this information, but in the future measures could be adopted that do so.</p>\n<p>Several &#x2018;soft&#x2019; components of the data infrastructure index could be added, but currently lack adequate data. This includes the areas of skills and of partnerships between entities in the national statistical system. The SPI dashboard makes use of the PARIS21 led SDG indicator on whether the statistical legislations in countries met the standards of the UN Fundamental Principles of Statistics, but this was not incorporated into the overall SPI score, because of inadequate country coverage. This is also true of the PARIS21 led SDG indicator on whether the national statistical system is fully funded. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>An overall score is produced by combining the Statistical Performance Indicators to yield one single index. The statistical performance indicators have a nested structure, and the SPI Pillar 4 and Pillar 5 scores are formed by sequentially aggregating each level. To begin we produce a score for each dimension, which, unless otherwise stated, is an unweighted average of the indicators within that dimension. After computing a score for each dimension, a score for the pillar is computed as an unweighted average of the dimensions in that pillar. </p>\n<p>For Pillar 4 on data sources, censuses and surveys are given separate weights, so that censuses, surveys, admin data, and geospatial data each receives a weight of 1/4. While censuses and surveys are in the same pillar in the framework, and therefore each would typically only receive a weight of 1/6 (for a total weight of 1/3) in this dimension, because of their importance in producing many indicators, they are given extra weight such that they each gets a weight of 1/4 (for a total weight of 1/2).</p>\n<p>For SPI Pillar 5, only the standards and methods dimension is included in the final score, although additional indicators that had lower levels of country coverage are available in the SPI database.</p>\n<p>The SPI Pillar 4 and Pillar 5 scores have a maximum score of 100 and a minimum of 0. A score of 100 would indicate that a country has every single element that we measure. A score of 0 indicates that none are in available. </p>\n<p>The nested structure of the index and the summation methods used to build an overall score meet the axiomatic properties outlined in Cameron et al. 2021. These properties include symmetry, monotonicity, and subgroup decomposability. Symmetry refers to property where if the values of two indicators in a nesting are switched, then the resulting index scores are unaffected. Monotonicity implies that if the value of an indicator improves, then the resulting index scores improve as well. Subgroup decomposability results from the fact that the scores are a weighted average of the subgroups (either indicators, dimensions, pillars) that make up that score and so can be written as a linear combination of those subgroups.</p>\n<p>Scores for each dimension in Pillar 4 are discussed below:</p>\n<p><strong>Dimension 4.1: censuses and surveys</strong></p>\n<p>This indicator draws from data collected by the Statistical Performance Indicators team.

Birth registration establishes an individual&#x2019;s legal identity at birth. A legal identity, name, nationality, and proof of age, are important human rights. They enable individuals to be included in various government, social and private services, and include the right to vote, etc. Vital statistics are compiled using civil registration information on these vital events. The availability of reliable and up-to-date vital statistics depends on the level of development of civil registration programs. An effective civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system is critical for planning and monitoring programs across several sectors.</p>\n<p>Data comes from the UNSD Global SDG monitoring database.

First, a set of automated data checks are performed, which involve comparing new values added to the dataset to the values of previous years to highlight unexpected changes or outliers and applying a set of data validation rules to check if any values of any columns are outside of expected bounds. </p>\n<p>For new data added, the following validation checks are performed to highlight potential issues. First, the data set will be compared to the original dataset published on github. It is natural for some values to change from this vintage compared to last vintage, as the underlying data sources have been updated. However, this comparison helps to systematically monitor the differences and potentially highlight unexpected changes. The dataCompareR package is used for this purpose in R (Johnston et al. 2021).</p>\n<p>Second, the data set is compared to a set of expected values for each column. The exact expected values are listed in the appendix (Supplementary Information), but the general idea is to check that the values adhere to rational min/max values and positive correlate in expected ways. For instance, the availability of SDG indicators columns is the fraction of SDG indicators in a goal with a value in the previous 5 years. Thus, they should be between 0 and 1. Additionally, the countries and dates included are matched to a pre-specified expected list to uncover the accidental inclusion/exclusion of dates or countries. The validate R package is used for this purpose (van der Loo &amp; de Jonge (2021). </p>\n<p>Third, we examine the index using different weighting methods, which does not change the results significantly.

Similarly, wherever data for some indicators (countries) are in doubt, we also discuss with our country-based colleagues who are charged with daily monitoring of country development.

This package automatically checks that database adheres to a set of expectations including the number of countries, the time span covered by the indicators, and that the indicators themselves fall into predefined ranges (e.g. indicators scored between 0 and 1 all have values between 0 and 1). Second, a DECDG internal review takes place where indicators values for countries are shared within the DECDG team for review. At this opportunity, DECDG staff will have the opportunity to look at country scores for each indicator and comment on whether these reflect ground truth. Finally, country scores will be sent out the regional directors for information. In this case, regional reports will be produced for each World Bank region, which include the regional aggregate score and the score for other regions, the country scores for countries within each region, and time trends for that region.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>To create a layer of transparency and accountability, the SPI team maintains an <a href=\"https://github.com/worldbank/SPI\">SPI github repository</a>, so users can track changes to the raw information collected in detail through the version control tools of Github. The github repository contains the version control history of the code and data, which documents every change in the data and code of the entire project dating back to July 2020 to build confidence and transparency. Any user can openly view how an indicator was constructed, and any change to the code or data that took place back to July 2020, before the project launch.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Prior to release, the SPI team produces a &#x201C;what&#x2019;s new&#x201D; publication detailing information about the data production process.
