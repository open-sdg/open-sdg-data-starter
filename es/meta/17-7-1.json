ESTs protect the environment, are less polluting, use resources in a sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products, and handle all residual wastes in a more environmentally acceptable way than the technologies for which they are substitutes. ESTs are not just individual technologies. They can also be defined as total systems that include know-how, procedures, goods and services, and equipment, as well as organizational and managerial procedures for promoting environmental sustainability. This means that any attempt to provide an assessment of investment into ESTs on either a global or national level must incorporate ways to track funding flows into both hard and soft technologies.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this indicator is to develop a methodology for tracking the total amount of approved funding to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies. A two-pronged approach is suggested: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Level 1. Use globally available data to create a proxy of funding flowing to developing countries for environmentally sound technologies, or of trade in environmentally sound technologies </li>\n  <li>Level 2. Collect national data on investment in environmentally sound technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>There are five crucial elements which make up Goal 17 - finance, capacity building, systemic issues, technology and trade- all of which must be aligned for the Goal to be achieved. One of the key lessons over the last couple of decades has been that in order to achieve potential growth, measurement of financial flows (in terms of amount, type, geography, donor, recipient and investors) is a necessary step in such a transformation. In order to understand systemic issues, trade, capacity building, technology lock-in, innovation and deployment, we must understand how, why and where finance is being deployed. Only then we can begin to realign its flows.</p>\n<p>In deciding which technologies are most appropriate, there will always be trade-offs between cost and a range of economic, social, health and environmental impacts, to be determined based on national or local contexts and priorities. It would also not be feasible for all countries to strive towards the best available technologies globally if these are not appropriate in a domestic context. Given the highly contextual nature of ESTs, it is therefore something that is better defined at the national level, taking into account the national context and mainstream technologies nationally. However, there is a real need to support national, sub-national governments and other actors with decision-making and defining the most nationally or locally appropriate technologies.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Current United States Dollars</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li>International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Rev.4.</li>\n  <li>Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (UN M49 classification of countries and regions).</li>\n  <li>Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding Systems (HS).</li>\n</ul>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>Level 1: the United Nations Comtrade database.</p>\n<p>Level 2: National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and other members of the National Statistical System (NSS).</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>National data are collected through the UNEP Questionnaire on Environmentally Sound Technologies every two years. </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>First data collection in2021, then every 2 years.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>First reporting cycle in 2022, then every two years.</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and other members of the National Statistical System (NSS), complemented by global modelling</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was mandated as Custodian Agencies for indicator 17.7.1 by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Rational environmental management means making the best use of resources to meet basic human needs without destroying the sustaining and regenerative capacity of natural systems. This requires a good understanding of the intersecting elements within the larger frame of development and implies the adoption and use of alternative, environmentally sound development strategies and related technologies. ESTs play an important role to improve efficiency of resources (materials and energy), reduce pollution and waste from different sectors. The importance of Environmentally Sound Technology was first emphasized during Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and ever since it has become a major component of international environmental cooperation. Access to ESTs also play a central role in the ground-breaking agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda &#x2013; which is an implementing mechanism for the global Sustainable Development Goals (2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). The agreement was reached by the 193 UN Member States.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Various definitions of &#x2018;environmentally sound technology&#x2019; exist and are in use.
