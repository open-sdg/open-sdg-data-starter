It provides information about the relative share of output which accrues to workers as compared with the share that accrues to capital in the production process for a given reference period.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>Compensation of employees is the total in-cash or in-kind remuneration payable to the employee by the enterprise for the work performed by the employee during the accounting period. Compensation of employees includes: (i) wages and salaries (in cash or in kind) and (ii) social insurance contributions payable by employers. This concept views compensation of employees as a cost to employer, thus compensation equals zero for unpaid work undertaken voluntarily. Moreover, it does not include taxes payable by employers on the wage and salary bill, such as payroll tax.</p>\n<p>The indicator should be produced using data that cover all economic activities, all employees, and the self-employed.

The share of labour compensation in national output can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher incomes for employees over time (and/or higher earnings for the self-employed). In periods of economic recession, the labour income share provides an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces labour income relative to profits. If labour income falls at a greater rate than profits, the labour income share will be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline in profits than in labour income, the share will rise. For any given level of GDP and profits, the labour income share can fall as a result of falling wages, falling earnings of the self-employed, changes in the composition of employment by income or a combination these.</p>\n<p>Increased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals in the economy, but this will depend on the distribution of real income and public policy among other factors. </p>\n<p>If there is a large number of non-resident border or seasonal workers or inflows and outflows of property income such that the value of production differs from the income of residents, there may be a situation of over or understating the living standards of residents.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>GDP may exclude or underreport activities that are difficult to measure, such as transactions in the informal sector or in illegal markets, etc. thus understating the GDP. Moreover, GDP does not account for the social and environmental costs of production, and is therefore is not a good measure of the level of over-all wellbeing.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Labour share of Gross Domestic Product = (Total compensation of employees + Labour income of the self-employed) / Gross Domestic Product * 100</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with member States through the ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS). National data providers receive a link to the portal where they can review all national SDG data available on ILOSTAT.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>To ensure that the labour share data are internationally comparable, an adjustment for the labour income earned by the self-employed is necessary. Self-employment constitutes a large share of the global workforce. Moreover the share of the self-employed in the total workforce tends to be higher in countries with lower national income. As a consequence, using only national accounts data on compensation of employees &#x2013; computing the unadjusted labour share &#x2013; reduces international comparability.</p>\n<p>Using the ILO Harmonized Microdata collection, the labour income of the self-employed relative to the labour income of employees is imputed. The imputation is based on observable characteristics of workers, such as economic sector, occupation, education and age. For a description of the procedure please refer to sections 2.1-2.4 of: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/Labour%20income%20share%20and%20distribution.pdf\">The Global Labour Income Share and Distribution</a>. </p>\n<p>The labour income of the self-employed at the national level is computed on the basis of this estimate, and is added to the numerator of the expression in 4.c.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute missing values at the country level.

The regional and global labour shares are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that define the labour share - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to compute the share for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations at the country level.
