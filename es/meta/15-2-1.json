FAO is the custodian UN agency for 21 SDG indicators, including 15.2.1.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The definition of SFM by the UN General Assembly contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances &#x2013; ecological, social and economic &#x2013; vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. </p>\n<p>Clearly a simple measure of forest area is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The significance of the five sub-indicators can be briefly explained as follows: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-indicator focuses on both the direction of change (whether there is a loss or gain in forest area) and how the change rate varies over time; the latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are losing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest area loss. </li>\n  <li>Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the balance between gains in biomass stock due to forest growth and losses due to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and diseases. At country level and over a longer period, sustainable forest management would imply a stable or increasing biomass stock per hectare, while a long-term reduction of biomass stock per hectare would imply either unsustainable management of the forests and degradation or unexpected major losses due to fire, wind, pests or diseases. </li>\n  <li>The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy for trends in conservation of forest biodiversity as well as cultural and spiritual values of forests and thus a clear indication of the political will to protect and conserve forests. This indicator is related to the CBD Aichi Target 11 which calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas. </li>\n  <li>The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest area that is under a long-term forest management plan. The existence of a documented forest management plan is the basis for long term and sustainable management of the forest resources for a variety of management objectives such as for wood and non-wood forest products, protection of soil and water, biodiversity conservation, social and cultural use, and a combination of two or several of these. An increasing area under forest management plan is therefore an indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management. </li>\n  <li>The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an independently verified forest management certification scheme. Such certification schemes apply standards that generally are higher than those established by the countries&#x2019; own normative frameworks, and compliance is verified by an independent and accredited certifier. An increase in certified forest area therefore provides an additional indication of progress towards sustainable forest management. It should however be noted that there are significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible or affordable certification scheme is in place for that area. </li>\n</ol>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, as the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. </p>\n<p>While the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>National data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under management plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on the country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate using the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under management plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference year 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme are reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly adjusting the figures to remove any double accounting. </p>\n<p>No dashboard traffic lights are made at country level. </p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>All data submitted by countries to FRA, including the FAO estimates made in case of desk studies, are available at the FRA on-line platform (<a href=\"http://fra-platform.herokuapp.com\">http://fra-platform.herokuapp.com</a>).

The value of the data point closest in time was used as imputed value. For those countries where no value was reported for any of the reporting years, no imputation was done and the values for all years were set as &#x201C;Not Available&#x201D;. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See above. </p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>See Annex 2 &#x2013; Methodology.

The reporting template requests that countries provide the full reference for original data sources as well as national definitions and terminology. Separate sections in the template country reports deal with the analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and projections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the official land area as held by FAO; and reclassification of data to the classes used in FAO&#x2019;s Global Forest Resources Assessments. </p>\n<p>Regarding the data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme, these are usually not part of official national statistics, and are maintained by local offices of the respective certification schemes. They in turn report their data to their head offices. As certified forest area is dynamic and can change monthly as some certificates expire and new certificates come. Therefore, the data are requested to correspond to the end of June each year. However, data are not always reported by the local offices according to that date. </p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL: </strong><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/en/\"><u>http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/en/</u></a> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, Guidelines and Specifications (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/I8699EN/i8699en.pdf\"><u>www.fao.org/3/I8699EN/i8699en.pdf</u></a>)</p>\n<p>Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, Terms and Definitions (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf\"><u>www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf</u></a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Annex 1 &#x2013; Terms and Definitions </strong></p>\n<p><strong>FOREST</strong></p>\n<p>Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with <u>tree</u>s higher than 5 meters and a <u>canopy cover</u> of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds <em>in situ</em>.
