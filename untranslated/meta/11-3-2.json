They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and national governments should strive to: <strong>a)</strong> facilitate and protect people&#x2019;s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; <strong>b)</strong> promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; <strong>c)</strong> remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have therefore put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>City or urban area</strong>: Since 2016 UN-Habitat and partners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> </sup>This definition combines population size and population density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a country along the urban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense neighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied in a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, contiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. </p>\n<p><strong>Other concepts</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Democratic participation:</strong> Structures allow and encourage participation of civil society representing a cross-section of society that allows for equal representation of all members of the community with equal rights for participation and voting. </p>\n<p><strong>Direct participation:</strong> Structures allow and encourage civil society accessing and actively engaging in decision-making, without intermediaries, at every stage of the urban planning and management process.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular participation:</strong> Structures allow and encourage civil society participation in urban planning and management processes at every stage, and at least every six months.</p>\n<p><strong>Marginalized groups:</strong> Groups of people that are not traditionally given equal voice in governance processes. These include, but are not limited to, women, young men and women, low-income communities, ethnic minorities, religious minorities, people with disabilities, the elderly, and sexual and gender identity minorities and migrants.</p>\n<p><strong>Structures:</strong> Any formal structure that allows for participation of civil society. This can include, but is not limited to national or local legislation, policy, town council meetings, websites, elections, suggestion boxes, appeals processes, notice period for planning proposals etc. </p>\n<p><strong>Civil Society:</strong> The combination of non-governmental organizations, community groups, community-based organizations, regional representative groups, unions, research institutes, think tanks, professional bodies, non-profit sports and cultural groups, and any other groups that represent the interests and wills of the members and wider community. </p>\n<p><strong>Urban Management:</strong> The officials, including elected officials and public servants, that are responsible for city-management, across all sectors, such as roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.</p>\n<p>Urban Budget decision making: The process by which money is allocated to various sectors of urban management, including roads, roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Urban Planning, including Design and Agreements</strong>: The technical and political process that concerns the development and use of land, how the natural environment is used etc. Design includes over-arching and specific design of public space, as well as zoning and land use definitions. Agreements refer to specific contract/arrangements made with various groups in regard to their land, e.g. Indigenous groups, protected natural environments etc.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> A recommendation on the method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons. <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-E.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-E.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Proportion (Percentage)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>Option 1: Evaluators will examine structures at the city level, with data aggregated from city levels for national averages through local national statistical systems constituted and chaired by the national Statistical agencies.</p>\n<p>Option 2: For countries where civil society engagement is covered within the law as a requirement and legally enforced, evaluators can provide a direct national level assessment of the practice and coverage for the cities as one estimated percentage.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Option 1: To measure the level of direct participation structures of civil society in urban planning and management at the city level, a scorecard approach will be used to evaluate the available structures for civil society participation in urban planning and management, as evaluated by five (5) local experts including those from academia, Urban Planning Experts, City Leaders and officials from Local Government Authorities. </p>\n<p>As part of the monitoring and reporting on SDG 11, UN-Habitat developed an online questionnaire until Kobo toolbox (<a href=\"https://ee.humanitarianresponse.info/x/sh3jEDMr\">https://ee.humanitarianresponse.info/x/sh3jEDMr</a>) that NSOs can administer to stakeholders on public participation in urban planning and management to evaluate public participation in urban planning programs in their cities. </p>\n<p>To note, the selection of cities in which the evaluation will be conducted may be determined using the National Sample of Cities approach (<a href=\"https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/06/national_sample_of_cities_english.pdf\">https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/06/national_sample_of_cities_english.pdf</a>).

The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including General Assembly resolution 3327 (XXIX), by which the General Assembly established the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation, and resolution 32/162 by which the Assembly established the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat). In 2001, by its Resolution 56/206, the General Assembly transformed the Habitat into the secretariat of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), with a mandate to coordinate human settlements activities within the United Nations System. As such, UN-Habitat has been designated the overall coordinator of SDG 11 and specifically as a custodian agency for 9 of the 14 indicators under SDG 11 including indicator 11.3.2. UN-Habitat also supports the monitoring and reporting of 4 urban specific indicators in other goals.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, urban managers and planners to integrate resident and civil society participation in urban planning and management at various levels. Local authorities and governments, along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing the value of civil society and residents&#x2019; participation in strengthening the urban development processes. This people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for local ownership, and the implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels.</p>\n<p>Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between government and the public by communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when urban planning decisions are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is a negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide varieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and nature of problems and potential solutions facing different urban settings. </p>\n<p>Urban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions. Public participation means a broader consensus is built and this greatly enhances political interaction between citizens and government, and enhances the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more effective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to deliver it. </p>\n<p>Civil society and public participation in urban management and governance also shows respect to participants&#x2019; opinion, needs, aspirations and assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and politics, and strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When conflicting claims and views are considered, there is a much higher possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the outcome. This has broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society and more inclusive and sustainable urban environments.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the availability of structures for civil society participation in urban planning and management, which is a reflection of structures for citizen voices/participation. The fact that informed evaluators conduct the evaluation can introduce biases. These biases and discrepancies have been examined in the pilot phases and so far the experiences is that the marginal differences are not as large as we were expecting. Overall, the evaluators&#x2019; assessments sometimes do not reflect a full analysis of the effectiveness or accessibility of these structures in its totality, but gives a local idea of how these evaluators view the inclusiveness and openness on these structures to accommodate the participation of citizens and civil society. Changes in data will be examined for intra-city differences and within country differences over time to understand more sources for variations and internal consistencies. </p>\n<p>Within the civic society landscape, there are many types of players including civil societies led by individuals, community groups, advocates, corporations and foundations. Similarly, there are many different views about the relevance and importance of civil society participation particularly, perhaps, among different groups as listed above and for these different structures at the urban level maybe available for involvement or not. </p>\n<p>Finally, civic society engagement in urban planning and management involves overlapping pathways, and goals as well as a mix of planned and unpredicted elements. Advancing toward a measurement frame is intended to help sort out theories and pathways &#x2013; not to set hard boundary lines, but rather to help both urban managers and communities better understand what they are trying to achieve, and how they are getting there.</p>\n<p>We also recognize that there are some countries where the legal instruments that govern cities and municipalities require that civil society are involved in the day-to-day urban planning and management of cities/municipalities. Hence, such countries can report directly the national level engagement of civil society as 100%, if in practice all municipalities apply the legal requirements for civil society engagement in urban planning and management.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>To measure existence of direct participation structures of civil society in urban planning and management at the city level, we recommend two options:- </p>\n<p>1-For countries where there is no legal requirement for civil society engagement and the practice is also not known at the city or municipality levels OR For countries where there is a legal requirement for civil society engagement in urban planning and management but however the practice is not known across the system of cities.</p>\n<p> 2- For countries where there is a legal requirement for civil society engagement in urban planning and management and the practice is also known across the system of cities and municipalities.</p>\n<p>Option 1: a scorecard approach will be used to evaluate the available structures for civil society participation in urban planning and management, as evaluated by five (5) local experts from government, academia, civil society and international organizations. The identifications and selection of these 5 local evaluators/experts will be guided by local urban observatories teams that are available in many cities. In the pilot exercises, these urban observatories as local custodians of urban data at the city level are able to coordinate the assessments and check for consistencies and relevant local references that guide the decisions and scores of the evaluators.</p>\n<p>A questionnaire with a 4-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree) will be used to measure and test the existence of structures for civil society participation in urban governance and management. As experts, we agreed that these structures are examined through four core elements and these were assessed in the completed pilot exercises as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Are there structures for civil society participation in urban planning, including design and agreements, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>\n  <li>Are there structures for civil society participation in local urban budget decision-making, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>\n  <li>Are there structures for civil society evaluation and feedback on the performance of urban management, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>\n  <li>Do these structures promote the participation of women, young men and women, and/or other marginalized groups?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The evaluators score each of the questions on the Likert Scale, as below: </p>\n<p>1 - Strongly disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Agree, 4 - Strongly agree</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Questions</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Strongly Disagree</p>\n        <p>(1)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Disagree</p>\n        <p>(2)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Agree</p>\n        <p>(3)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Strongly Agree</p>\n        <p>(4)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Are there structures for civil society participation in urban planning, including design and agreements that are direct, regular and democratic?</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Are there structures for civil society participation in urban budget decision making that are direct, regular and democratic?</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Are there structures for civil society evaluation and feedback on the performance of urban management, which are direct, regular and democratic?</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Do the structures promote the participation of women, young men and women, and/or other marginalized groups?</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Likert Scale use the following guidance for grading: </p>\n<p><strong>Strongly Disagree:</strong> There are no structures in place or available structures do not allow civil society participation that is direct, regular or democratic.</p>\n<p><strong>Disagree:</strong> Structures exist that allow civil society participation, but they are only partially direct, regular and democratic; or they are only one of direct, regular or democratic.</p>\n<p><strong>Agree:</strong> Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society participation that is direct and/or regular and/or democratic, but not all three. </p>\n<p><strong>Strongly Agree</strong>: Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society participation that is fully direct, regular and democratic.</p>\n<p>Once each of the five (5) categories is evaluated as shown in the table above by a single evaluator, the total average score of the single evaluator is computed.
