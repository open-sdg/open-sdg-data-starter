indicator_number: 8.5.2
indicator_definition: The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization
  of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment
  for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available
  for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the
  efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the
  performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate
  can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator
  often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of
  an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test
  conditions through an active job search.
