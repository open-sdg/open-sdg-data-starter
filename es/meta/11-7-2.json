While sexual harassment refers to behaviour with a sexual connotation that is suitable to intimidate their victims, physical harassment refers to all other harassing behaviours that can cause fear for physical integrity and/or emotional distress. For use in a survey, it is necessary to further operationalize the concept and to identify more precisely the set of behaviours and their circumstances to be considered as harassment. On the basis of past surveys, expert discussions and with the inputs from the network of UN-CTS National Focal Points<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></sup>, a set of pertinent behaviours was identified and formulated for testing in a pilot survey module. The first tests of the survey module were carried out in 2019 in Nigeria and Saint Lucia and the revised survey module was included in a large representative household survey in Nigeria (sample 33,000 interviews) in June 2019, conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of Nigeria. The module will also be included in a 2019 pilot survey conducted by the National Statistical Office of Mexico (INEGI) and in a full household survey in Saint Lucia in 2019.</p>\n<p>While the precise formulation and wording of the pertinent survey questions may need national customization, a core set of behaviours have been identified as forms of harassment exercised towards a person (see Annex A of the Methodology Development Narrative). </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> This network is formed of national representatives - appointed by Member States &#x2013; from either National Statistical Offices or other government agencies directly involved in the production and dissemination of statistical data on crime and criminal justice. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The Indicator is based on eight questions to be included in a household survey.

Besides the emotional and psychological harm suffered, harassment can have negative consequences on the ability of its victims to fully participate in public life and to share in and contribute to the development of their communities. For example, the widespread occurrence of sexual harassment in the workplace can lead to a lower participation of women in the workforce, especially in male-dominated occupations, and lower their income-generating capacity.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Like other experience-based indicators on victimization, the indicator reflects the experience from the perspective of the victim. As such, the response provided by the victims reflects their experience as well as their subjective feeling of victimization, irrespective of whether actual harm was intended or not. The subjective feeling of victimization is an important component of safety and security across space and time (for example, in cities or in the domestic sphere) and a higher prevalence of experienced physical or sexual harassment indicates a negative environment that warrants appropriate responses and interventions. </p>\n<p>Like other survey-based indicators, the scope of the indicator also relies on the design and sampling strategy of the survey. For example, most surveys set a low age-limit for practical and ethical reasons (e.g. 18 years and older), which means that data are representative for youth under 18 years.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup></sup> Harassment specifically linked to disability requires relatively large sample sizes in order to obtain a sufficiently large number of disabled persons in the sample.</p>\n<p>The same behaviour can have different meanings and therefore have a different impact across cultural contexts and population groups. For this reason, the selection of &#x2018;harassment&#x2019; behaviours has been made also with the view of identifying situations of harassment that can be perceived as such across different social and cultural contexts. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> Other age limits (e.g. 15+ years) may be applied if consistent with national practices. Some surveys are also specifically designed to cover the youth and adolescent population, for example the Social Cohesion Survey to Prevent Violence and Crime (ECOPRED) conducted by the National Statistics Office of Mexico (INEGI) targets youth 12 years and older. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Number of persons who experienced a form of physical harassment and/or sexual harassment, divided by the total population.

The six surveys (conducted by Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Mexico and Sweden) that measured physical and/or sexual harassment did so using different methodologies and question formulations, so the results are not directly comparable.</p>\n<p>Another important source of data on sexual harassment is a survey on violence against women conducted by the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency in all 28 EU Member States in 2013 (sample size 42,000 interviewees).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup> The measurement of sexual harassment was based on 11 types of behaviours (items) that have also been used to develop the survey module for SDG indicator 11.7.2.</p>\n<p>Finally, various modules on physical and sexual harassment have been tested in a recent survey in Nigeria. Following pilot testing and revisions of the module, the proposed module has been included in a large-scale household survey in June 2019 (sample 33,000 interviews) and found to be useful and feasible (see Annex A and B of the Methodology Development Narrative).</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator has recently been included into the annual United Nations Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS), the regular data collection used by UNODC to collect data from UN Member States.
