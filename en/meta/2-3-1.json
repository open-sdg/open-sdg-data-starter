These contain information on agricultural production, economic variables and labour input. However, agricultural surveys are not conducted in a systematic way, so they may be scattered in long time periods. FAO promotes the Agricultural Integrated Surveys (AGRIS) which collects data in a yearly basis for different modules, e.g. agricultural production. </p>\n<p>Currently, the indicator is produced mainly using the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) of the World Bank. Some countries contain an Integrated Surveys of Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). These surveys include information such as farm size, disaggregation by geographic areas, type of activities and type of households, values of output, values of production costs and number of work hours in different activities. Such surveys have data relevant to the computation of the indicators.</p>\n<p>FAO, along with the World Bank and IFAD are compiling harmonized indicators of rural livelihoods with information on micro-level household data the LSMS surveys and other household surveys publicly available in the initiative called RuLIS (Rural Livelihoods Information System) which includes the indicators disaggregated by gender, rural areas, urban areas, income quintiles and income percentage that comes from agriculture.</p>\n<p>Some of the datasets utilized to do the computation of the indicator 2.3.1. can be seen in Annex 1 of the document &#x201C;Methodology for Computing and Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.&#x201D; available in <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/ca3043en/CA3043EN.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/ca3043en/CA3043EN.pdf</a> and Annex 1 of the document &#x201C;Rural Livelihoods Information System (RuLIS).

The indicator monitors progress in this area, where the target is to double productivity by year 2030. </p>\n<p>The enhancement of labour productivity in small-scale production units also has implications on poverty reduction, as small-scale food producers are often poor, and are frequently found to be close to subsistence conditions.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Given the approved methodology, the computation of the indicator requires survey microdata collected at the farm level on a wide range of variables &#x2013; including all elements that allow computing revenues and costs of the enterprise, together with labour input and the availability of land and livestock &#x2013; referred to the same production unit. Such type of surveys are seldom collected at the national level. For this reason, the availability of data for the indicator is altogether limited. In some countries, data can be obtained from household surveys reporting details on agricultural production. These data sources have to be considered as second-best solution, given that their sampling is focused on households and not on food production units. While in many countries there is a considerable degree of overlap between the population of food producers and households, this is still a partial overlap, which can undermine the accuracy of the computation.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">D</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">G</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mn>2</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>3</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>2</mn>\n        <mo>.</mo>\n        <mn>3</mn>\n        <mo>.</mo>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mrow>\n          <munderover>\n            <mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x2211;</mo>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi>j</mi>\n              <mo>=</mo>\n              <mn>1</mn>\n            </mrow>\n            <mrow>\n              <mi>n</mi>\n            </mrow>\n          </munderover>\n          <mrow>\n            <mo>(</mo>\n            <mfrac>\n              <mrow>\n                <mrow>\n                  <munder>\n                    <mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x2211;</mo>\n                    <mrow>\n                      <mi>i</mi>\n                    </mrow>\n                  </munder>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <msubsup>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>V</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>i</mi>\n                        <mi>j</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>t</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                    </msubsup>\n                    <msubsup>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>p</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>i</mi>\n                        <mi>j</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                      <mrow>\n                        <mi>t</mi>\n                      </mrow>\n                    </msubsup>\n                  </mrow>\n                </mrow>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <msubsup>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>L</mi>\n                    <mi>d</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>j</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>t</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                </msubsup>\n              </mrow>\n            </mfrac>\n            <mo>)</mo>\n          </mrow>\n        </mrow>\n      </mrow>\n      <mo>/</mo>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mrow>\n  </math></p>\n<p>where: </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>j</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n  </math> is the physical volume of agricultural product i sold by the small-scale food producer j during year t; </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>j</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n  </math> is the constant sale price received by the small-scale food producer j for the agricultural product i during same year t; </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msubsup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>L</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>j</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msubsup>\n  </math> is the number of labour days utilized by the small-scale food producer j during year t; </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n  </math>is the number of small-scale food producers. </p>\n<p>As the indicator is referred to a set of production units &#x2013; those of a small scale &#x2014; the denominator needs to summarize information on the entire production undertaken in each unit.
