The concept of &#x201C;substance use disorders&#x201D; includes both &#x201C;drugs use disorders&#x201D; and &#x201C;alcohol use disorders&#x201D; according to the <a href=\"https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en\" target=\"_blank\">International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 and ICD-11)</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The term &#x201C;drugs&#x201D; refers to controlled psychoactive substances as scheduled by the three <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Drug Control Conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988)</a>, substances controlled under national legislation and new psychoactive substances (NPS) that are not controlled under the Conventions, but may pose a public health threat. &#x201C;Alcohol&#x201D; refers to ethanol - a psychoactive substance with dependence producing properties that is consumed in ethanol-based or alcoholic beverages. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>People with substance use disorders are those with harmful substance use and/or affected by substance dependence. Harmful substance use is defined in the ICD-11 as a pattern of use of substances that has caused damage to a person&#x2019;s physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour leading to harm to the health of others. According to ICD-11, dependence arises from repeated or continuous use of psychoactive substances. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use psychoactive substance, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Treatment of substance use disorder -any structured intervention that is aimed specifically to a) reduce substance use and cravings for substance use; b) improve health, well-being and social functioning of the affected individual, and c) prevent future harms by decreasing the risk of complications and relapse. These may include pharmacological treatment, psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation and aftercare. All evidence-based used for treatment of substance use disorders are well defined in WHO and UNODC related documents. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><u>Pharmacological treatment</u> refers to interventions that include detoxification, opioid agonist maintenance therapy (OAMT) and antagonist maintenance (WHO, UNODC International Standards for the treatment of drug use disorders, 2016). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><u>Psychosocial interventions</u> refer to programs that address motivational, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental factors related to substance use and have been shown to reduce drug use, promote abstinence and prevent relapse. For different drug use disorders, the evidence from clinical trials supports the effectiveness of treatment planning, screening, counselling, peer support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), community reinforcement approach (CRA), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), family therapy (FT) modalities, contingency management (CM), counselling, insight-oriented treatments, housing and employment support among others. (UNODC WHO International Standards for the Treatment of Drug Use Disorders, 2016). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><u>Rehabilitation and aftercare</u> (Recovery Management and Social Support) refers to interventions that are based on scientific evidence and focused on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration dedicated to treat drug use disorders. </p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The sources include: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Household surveys </li>\n  <li>Surveys among people using substances &#x2013; using for instance respondent driven sampling </li>\n  <li>Indirect methods such as capture/recapture or multiplier benchmark method </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Surveys should be nationally representative, with a sample size sufficiently large to capture relevant events and compute needed disaggregation, and they should be based on a solid sample design.

Also, countries are encouraged to use less costly alternatives to estimate the number of people with substance use disorders and service utilization, taking advantage of the availability of administrative data through the use of indirect estimation methods. Collection of data from countries is planned on annual or biannual basis. </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on relevant SDG indicators are collected, compiled and sent back to countries for data review annually. Data are then reported to UNSD through the regular reporting channels annually. </p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>Drug use disorders data are collected through national focal points. Data providers vary by country and they can be institutions such as Drug Control Agencies, National Drug Observatories, Ministries of Health and/or National Statistical Offices. </p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>Data will be compiled by the co-custodians for this indicator (UNODC and WHO). </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>According to UNODC and WHO data, around 271 million people aged 15 to 64 years worldwide used an illicit drug at least once in 2017, about 2.3 billion people are current drinkers of alcohol, some 35 million of people suffer from drug use disorders and 289 million from alcohol use disorders. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Substance use disorders are serious health conditions that present a significant burden for affected individuals, their families and communities. Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs to society including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal justice, social welfare, and other social consequences. Strengthening treatment services entails providing access to a comprehensive set of evidence-based interventions (-laid down in the international standards and guidelines) that should be available to all population groups in need. The indicator will inform the extent to which a range of evidence-based interventions for treatment of substance use disorder are available and are accessed by the population in need at country, regional and global level. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Even though effective treatment exists, only a small amount of people with substance use disorders receive it. For instance, it is estimated that globally one out of 7 people with drug use disorders have access to or provided drug treatment services (World Drug Report 2019). <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/substance_abuse/en/\" target=\"_blank\">WHO ATLAS-Substance Use</a> data showed that in 2014 only 11.9 % (out of 103 responding) countries reported high coverage (40% or more) for alcohol dependence. SDG indicator 3.5.1 is crucial for measurement the progress towards strengthening the treatment of substance abuse worldwide as formulated in the Target 3.5. </p>\n<p> </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The two main challenges in terms of computing the SDG 3.5.1 indicator are the limited availability of household surveys on substance use and the under-reporting of use among survey respondents. </p>\n<p>Data reported from household surveys are one of the sources of information on of the number of people with substance use disorders. There are issues of under-reporting for certain psychoactive substances, in countries where stigma is associated to substance use and when a considerable proportion of the drug or alcohol using population is institutionalized, homeless or unreachable by population-based surveys. Additionally, being a relatively rare event, household surveys on substance use disorders require a large sample and can be costly. In order to address these issues, additional approaches (e.g. scale up methods) are increasingly used in household surveys to address undercount issues. These can be used in conjunction with special studies and/or additional information, in order to obtain reasonable estimates via indirect methods, such as benchmark/multiplier or capture-recapture methods. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An additional step in data validation and country capacity building for monitoring treatment coverage for substance use disorders will be implemented during the next couple of years for in-depth data generation in a sample of countries from different regions and representing different levels of health system development. A rapid assessment tool for in-depth data generation is in the process of development by WHO. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The indicator stresses on type, availability and coverage of services but does not necessarily provide information on the actual quality of the interventions/services provided. To address this, at national level, the proposed treatment indicator will be accompanied with contextual information on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for substance use disorders to provide additional information for interpretation of the contact coverage data. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator will be computed by dividing the number of people receiving treatment services at least once in a year by the total number of people with substance use disorders in the same year: </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>S</mi>\n        <mi>U</mi>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">b</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">U</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">D</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">b</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">w</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">h</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">U</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">D</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>X</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Where: SUD &#x2013; Substance use disorders </p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>At country level </strong></p>\n<p>For drug use disorder, data will be provided for countries where information is available for both numerator and denominator.
