Earnings exclude employers&#x2019; contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees&#x2019; gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees.

For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Continuous </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Continuous</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>At the national level, the agency responsible for producing data on earnings is usually the national statistical office. </p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) </p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics.

Information on hourly earnings disaggregated by various classifications (sex, age, occupation, disability status) provide some indication of the extent to which pay equality is respected or achieved. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage, scope and characteristics. It would not be fully accurate to compare, for example, hourly earnings from a labour force survey for one country with hourly earnings from an establishment survey for another. The use of non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied further hamper cross-country comparisons. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Computation Method:</strong> </p>\n<p>The method of calculation used to obtain the average hourly earnings of employees depends on the source of data used and the type of information it provides. For instance, where there is information available on each worker&#x2019;s hourly earnings and hours worked, the average is a weighted average calculated by summing up the product of each worker&#x2019;s hourly earnings times the hours worked and dividing it by the total number of hours worked by all workers.
