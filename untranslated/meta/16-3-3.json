While in many countries courts represent the main institution dealing with disputes of civil nature, the same may not be true in countries or societies where the first point of reference in such cases are informal systems, traditional or religious leaders.

This demand is composed of those who use dispute resolution mechanisms (users) and those who - despite needing them - do not have &#x201C;access&#x201D; to such mechanisms for various reasons such as lack of knowledge on how to access them, lack of trust in institutions, lack of legal advice/assistance, lack of awareness about justice mechanisms, geographical distance or financial costs, to mention a few. It is important to exclude from the demand those who experience disputes and do not turn to dispute resolution mechanisms because they do not need them (voluntarily self-excluded). This refers to cases where the dispute is simple or when respondents solve the issue with the other party through direct negotiation.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> Genn, G, <em>Paths to Justice: What People Do and Think About Going to Law </em>(Oxford: Hart, 1999), 12. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> See <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/governance/legal-needs-surveys-and-access-to-justice-g2g9a36c-en.htm\"><em>Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice</em></a><em> </em>, OECD (2019) <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Percentage/proportion</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The Indicator is based on four questions to be included in a household survey.

The rationale of this indicator is to focus on one step of the process and in particular on the accessibility of justice institutions and mechanisms (both formal and informal) by those who have experienced a justiciable problem. The indicator can provide important information about the overall accessibility of civil justice institutions and processes, barriers, and reasons for exclusion of some people.

A way to address this issue is to focus on a number of possible disputes that can be considered of justiciable nature across most countries, as for example the one listed in the section above<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup>. Standardised descriptions of the most common types of disputes are also to be used in surveys in order to maximise comparability across different legal systems and countries. </p>\n<p>In order to identify the group of people in demand of dispute resolution mechanism it is necessary to identify the group of people voluntarily self-excluded. A way to identify this group is by including an additional question about the reasons why people did not use a dispute resolution mechanism. This question would allow to differentiate cases of voluntary and involuntary exclusion and define the denominator as the population who experienced a problem minus the voluntarily self-excluded.</p>\n<p>Another challenge refers to identifying possible dispute resolution mechanisms as they vary considerably in different countries around the world. The formulation of the questions in the survey has to take into account these different possibilities and make sure to include all relevant institutions generally recognized in the community. This proposed list of dispute resolution mechanisms identifies those that are common in most countries in the world but it can be adapted to the country context.</p>\n<p>The share of population experiencing the disputes under investigation can be of relatively small size and this can influence the statistical significance of results. A way to address this is to increase the survey&#x2019;s reference period, recognizing that respondents&#x2019; ability to recall specific issues becomes increasingly unreliable the further back in time it extends. For these reasons, this proposal follows the recommendation from the Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice methodological guidance and suggests a reference interval of two years. With such reference period resulting data would be suitable for monitoring recent changes in contexts/policies while being based on a sufficient number of cases to ensure statistical significance of analyses .<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup> Possible telescoping effects (the effect of misplacement in time of events taking place in the past) need to be addressed properly by bounding in clear terms the time interval of reference in relevant questions. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-5\">4</sup><p> These types of disputes have broad applicability across countries as reflected in <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/governance/legal-needs-surveys-and-access-to-justice-g2g9a36c-en.htm\"><em>Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice</em></a><em> </em>, OECD (2019), which builds upon a review of more than 60 large-scale legal need surveys conducted over the past 25 years. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-5\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> Experimental evidence indicates that increasing a legal needs survey&#x2019;s reference period from one to three years has only &#x201C;a fairly modest&#x201D; impact on problem reporting [Pleasence et al.

Data producers are encouraged to strictly follow the data quality practices, protocols and frameworks in relation of data quality. In addition to the data, countries are requested to report on the metadata which serves as one additional layer of validation and verification of the data by confronting with the metadata used and the recommended for global reporting. Before publication by custodian agencies, a standardised &#x201C;pre-publication process&#x201D; is implemented, where national stakeholders can verify and review the data before publication. </p>\n<p> </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p>&#x2022; <strong>At country level</strong></p>\n<p>National data are not estimated if data derived from surveys conducted at country level are not available</p>\n<p>&#x2022; <strong>At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>There is no imputation of missing values.</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Regional aggregates are produced only when available data cover at least a certain percentage of countries of the region and the population of these countries account for a certain percentage of the regional population.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Methodological documentation from surveys conducted at national level is available (e.g. household survey in Nigeria conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and UNODC; Governance, Public Safety and Justice Survey conducted by Statistics South Africa in 2019, Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey 2015-2016 conducted by KNBS; Argentina - Unmet Legal Needs and Access to Justice conducted by the Subsecretar&#xED;a de Acceso a la Justicia Ministerio de Justicia y Derechos Humanos; or Colombia - National Quality of Life Survey conducted by DANE). </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice methodological guidance published by OECD in 2019 provides methodological guidance for developing the questionnaires and conducting such surveys.

However, the scale and methods of administration have varied. More than 60 national legal needs surveys have been conducted in more than 30 countries over the course of the last 25 years (4 by government statistical agencies, 18 by other government bodies, 3 by universities, and 37 by other organizations). National legal needs surveys have been conducted in Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil (module), Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, England and Wales, Georgia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Macedonia, Mali, Mexico (module), Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Poland, Scotland, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In addition, extensive sub-national surveys have also been carried out, for example, in China, Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia and Yemen, along with smaller surveys in countries including Azerbaijan, Rwanda and Egypt.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup> </p>\n<p>In Nigeria, the national statistical offices (NBS) recently conducted two successive large-scale surveys (2016 and 2019) &#x2013; with UNODC technical support &#x2013; that included a module on access to justice.
