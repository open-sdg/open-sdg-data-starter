While sustainable tourism is multidimensional in itself (with economic, social and environmental aspects), the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, indicates the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. Ideally, this indicator needs to be complemented with additional indicators on the social (e.g. employment, etc.) and environmental (energy use, GHG emissions, etc.) aspects of tourism that can be disaggregated to provide a more complete picture of the promotion of sustainable tourism and thus the monitoring of this target. </p>\n<p>This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at international, national level and the level of sub-national regions as it provides a measure of the economic contribution of tourism which can be compared over time, across countries, to total GDP and to the GDP contributions of other economic activities. Tourism Direct GDP includes the contributions from all forms of tourism&#x2014;inbound tourism, domestic tourism and outbound tourism&#x2014;in line with the International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008 (IRTS 2008). The indicator has been found especially useful in raising awareness of the economic importance of tourism and making the case for a more proactive, sustainable management of a sector that is often overlooked in policy agendas at all levels. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Given that a significant number of countries already have or are working to implement Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA), data on the suggested indicators could become available in more countries in the near future. </p>\n<p>The data demands for implementing TSA (detailed input-output or supply and use tables, among others); means that it is often not possible or cost effective to realize frequent updating of the TSA. Therefore, some countries produce estimates of TSA aggregates, in between reference years and/or nowcast estimates, to have more current data and to produce a time series. </p>\n<p>In the absence of important shocks to the economy and to tourism, historically TDGDP/GDP tended to not show very large variations from one year to the next, however the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on tourism are quite evident through this indicator in many countries. Considering also that variations may stem from the numerator and/or denominator, it is often useful from an analytical perspective to consider the indicator in different forms and adaptations: absolute value, % change in constant price, and TDGDP per visitor or per employed person. </p>\n<p>Related economic aggregates on tourism like Tourism Direct Gross Value Added and the Gross Value Added of the Tourism Industries (in aggregate form and disaggregated by tourism industry) are also important and may be used as approximations to indicator 8.9.1 for analytical purposes. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Tourism direct GDP as a proportion of total GDP (in%):</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mfenced separators=\"|\">\n      <mrow>\n        <mfrac>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>T</mi>\n            <mi>D</mi>\n            <mi>G</mi>\n            <mi>D</mi>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>G</mi>\n            <mi>D</mi>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </mfrac>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfenced>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Tourism direct GDP in growth rate</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mfenced open=\"[\" close=\"]\" separators=\"|\">\n      <mrow>\n        <mfenced separators=\"|\">\n          <mrow>\n            <mfrac>\n              <mrow>\n                <msub>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>T</mi>\n                    <mi>D</mi>\n                    <mi>G</mi>\n                    <mi>D</mi>\n                    <mi>P</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>t</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                </msub>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <msub>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>T</mi>\n                    <mi>D</mi>\n                    <mi>G</mi>\n                    <mi>D</mi>\n                    <mi>P</mi>\n                  </mrow>\n                  <mrow>\n                    <mi>t</mi>\n                    <mo>-</mo>\n                    <mn>1</mn>\n                  </mrow>\n                </msub>\n              </mrow>\n            </mfrac>\n          </mrow>\n        </mfenced>\n        <mo>-</mo>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfenced>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Every year historical data is requested.
