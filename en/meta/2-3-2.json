These contain information on agricultural production, economic variables and labour input. However, agricultural surveys are not conducted in a systematic way, so they may be scattered in long time periods. FAO promotes the Agricultural Integrated Surveys project (AGRISurvey) which collects data in a yearly basis for different modules, e.g. agricultural production. </p>\n<p>Currently, the indicator is produced globally using the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) of the World Bank. Some countries contain an Integrated Surveys of Agriculture (LSMS-ISA).

Such type of surveys are seldom collected at the national level. For this reason the availability of data for the indicator is altogether limited. In some countries, data can be obtained from household surveys reporting details on agricultural production. These data sources have to be considered as second-best solution, given that their sampling is focused on households and not on food production units. While in many countries there is a considerable degree of overlap between the population of food producers and households, this is still a partial overlap, which can undermine the accuracy of the computation. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Given i agricultural activities, including crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry activities, and j [1,&#x2026;,n] small scale food producers defined as in the first section as a subset of all N [1,&#x2026;,k] food producers, the SDG indicator 2.3.2 must be computed using the following formula: </p>\n<p>SDG 2.3.2=I_2.3.2^t=(&#x2211;_(j=1)^n&#x2592;(&#x2211;_i&#x2592;&#x3016;&#x3016;(V&#x3017;_ij^t p_ij^t &#x3017;- C_ij^t ) )&#x2044;n</p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> V_ij^t is the physical volume of agricultural product i sold by the small-scale food producer j during year t; </p>\n<p> p_ij^t is the constant sale price received by the small-scale food producer j for the agricultural product i during year t; </p>\n<p> C_ij^t is the production cost of agricultural product i supported by the small-scale food producer j during year t; </p>\n<p> n is the number of small-scale food producer. </p>\n<p>In details, physical volumes V_ik^t are derived, for each k producer, from the following items:</p>\n<p> Crop revenues: crop sold, crop for own consumption, crop used as feed, crop saved for seed, crop stored, crop used for by-products, crop given as gift, crop used for paying labour, crop used for paying rent, crop used for paying inputs, crop given out in sharecropping agreement (sharecrop out), crop wasted.
