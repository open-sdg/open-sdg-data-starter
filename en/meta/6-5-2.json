Approximately 40% of the world&#x2019;s population lives in river and lake basins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development of water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on countries sharing transboundary basins, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, which are often interlinked. Intensive water use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising the development aspirations of countries sharing transboundary basins and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is in many cases not advanced. </p>\n<p>Specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between countries sharing transboundary basins are a key precondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as reflected in the 1997 Watercourses Convention, the 1992 Water Convention, and the draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers, as well as existing experience and good practices, all point to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured by the four criteria for operationality.</p>\n<p>This is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and the importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the advancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).</p>\n<p>Progress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of indicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing activities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover all surface waters and groundwaters.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The spatial information on transboundary surface water basins&#x2019; boundaries and the extent of the catchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no updating need is expected.</p>\n<p>The information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information is generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical studies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification of additional transboundary aquifers.</p>\n<p>In situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with all its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such complementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from the reporting at the national level. </p>\n<p>The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters is commonly a long process that takes many years. </p>\n<p>The operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could potentially be observed.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifers in the territory of the country</p>\n<p>While the identification of transboundary surface water is relatively straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers often requires more considered investigations.</p>\n<p>If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable.</p>\n<p>Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sum</p>\n<p>Commonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. </p>\n<p>The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of systems (e.g. river and lakes basin and aquifers) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river or lake basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on transboundary aquifers. </p>\n<p>The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface river and lake basins and the aquifers can be used to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement exists on either one).</p>\n<p>Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary water cooperation and verify which transboundary waters are covered</p>\n<p>Some operational arrangements for transboundary water cooperation in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters (and their associated river and lakes basins and aquifers). In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate the indicator value. In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the river basin or sub-basin and in such cases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for calculating the indicator value. At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by arrangements for transboundary water cooperation (and their respective areas). </p>\n<p>Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary water cooperation are operational</p>\n<p>The following check-list allows countries to determinine whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular country is operational:</p>\n<p>- does a joint body or mechanism for transboundary water cooperation exist? </p>\n<p>- are there at least annual (on average) formal communication in form of meetings, either at the political and/or technical level?</p>\n<p>- has a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives been adopted? </p>\n<p>- is there at least annual (on average) exchange of information and data?</p>\n<p>If any of the conditions are not met, the arrangement for transboundary water cooperation cannot be considered operational. This information is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin databases.</p>\n<p>Step 5 Calculate the indicator value</p>\n<p>Calculate the indicator value, by adding up the total surface area in the country of the transboundary surface waters or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers). The sum should then be multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries are requested to submit data on their transboundary basins covered by operational arrangements through the uses of a reporting template or questionnaire. The templates are submitted to the co-custodian agencies, UNECE and UNESCO for review. Countries are encouraged to submit drafts of their templates to the custodian agencies for feedback prior to the final submission. Once submitted, the custodian agencies review the national templates to assess firstly, whether sufficient and accurate information is provided in order to calculate the national SDG indicator value, and secondly, whether an official endorsement of the template is provided (in the form of a signature).</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>In the case of spatial data: For the basin delineations, Digital Elevation Model information can be used to delineate surface water basin boundaries.
